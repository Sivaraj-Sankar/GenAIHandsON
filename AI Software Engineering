1.Firebase Cloud Messaging – FCM - cross-platform messaging and notification service provided by Google
Eg:
App registers with FCM → gets a device token (unique ID).
The bank’s backend (or any server) stores this token securely.
When there’s an event (e.g., new transaction), the backend calls FCM API with:
Token(s)
Message payload (title, body, or data)
FCM delivers the message to the correct device(s).
The app receives the message and either:
Displays it to the user (notification message).
Uses it silently to fetch fresh data from backend (data message).
-
Types of Messages
Notification Message
Automatically displayed by the system tray.
Example: "New transaction of $100 at Starbucks."
Data Message
Not shown to the user directly.
Used to trigger the app to fetch data from APIs.
Example: app receives { "refresh": true } and then calls the bank’s server securely.
-
Push Notifications: Send alerts or updates to users’ devices (e.g., "Your order has shipped", "New transaction detected").
Data Messages: Send silent messages that don’t show a notification but tell the app to refresh data in the background.
Topic Messaging: Send messages to groups of users subscribed to a "topic" (e.g., everyone who wants "Promotions").
Device-to-Device Messaging (through FCM servers).

2.Human Layer - handles routing, escalations, timeouts, and maintains audit trails of human decisions.
Because the integration happens at the tool-calling layer, HumanLayer works seamlessly with agent frameworks such as LangChain, CrewAI, or custom-built pipelines using any LLM that supports tool calling
HumanLayer is positioned to enable the safe progression to Gen 3 or Autonomous Agents—systems that initiate tasks without direct human prompts. In these advanced workflows, human consultation becomes essential for sensitive or high-impact actions. HumanLayer provides the infrastructure to ensure those consultations happen reliably and efficiently

From its Hacker News launch thread, HumanLayer has already been put into production for:
An AI SDR that drafts personalized emails but waits for human approval—via Slack—before sending to prospects.
An AI-powered newsletter that manages inbound emails, hands them to agents, and optionally seeks human guidance for responses.
A customer-facing DevOps assistant that reviews PRs and plans database migrations—but requires human sign-off at critical junctures.
