Build the simplest form of agentic RAG – a router. Given a query, the router will pick one of two query engines, Q&A or summarization, to execute a query over a single document.
Add tool calling to your router agent where you will use an LLM to not only pick a function to execute but also infer an argument to pass to the function.
Build a research assistant agent. Instead of tool calling in a single-shot setting, an agent is able to reason over tools in multiple steps.

Llamaindex Ingestion Pipeline  - chunk siz,lap, automerging=true
---------------------------------
💡 What is Automerging in LlamaIndex?
Automerging in LlamaIndex refers to the automatic consolidation of multiple nodes or chunks of documents into larger, semantically coherent chunks.

It's useful when:

You ingest documents that are too fragmented (e.g., one sentence per chunk).

You want to optimize retrieval and reduce token usage by merging semantically related nodes.

Automerging helps combine small, related nodes into bigger ones while preserving meaning and context.

📦 How it works (Conceptually)
LlamaIndex has a NodeParser (e.g., SentenceSplitter) that splits a document into nodes (chunks).
If these chunks are too small or many are semantically similar, automerging can:

Analyze the meaning of adjacent nodes.

Merge nodes based on:

Chunk size limits (e.g., max tokens or words).

Semantic similarity (optional).

Create fewer, bigger nodes to store in the vector index.

✅ Simple Code Example
python
Copy
Edit
from llama_index import VectorStoreIndex, SimpleDirectoryReader
from llama_index.node_parser import SentenceSplitter
from llama_index.ingestion import IngestionPipeline
from llama_index.ingestion.steps import (
    DocumentReader,
    NodeParser,
    EmbeddingGenerator,
    IndexingStep
)
from llama_index.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbedding

# 1. Load documents
documents = SimpleDirectoryReader("./data").load_data()

# 2. Create an automerging parser
node_parser = SentenceSplitter(chunk_size=512, chunk_overlap=50, automerge=True)

# 3. Set up ingestion pipeline
pipeline = IngestionPipeline(
    transformations=[
        NodeParser(parser=node_parser),
        EmbeddingGenerator(embed_model=OpenAIEmbedding()),  # or any embedding
        IndexingStep()
    ]
)

# 4. Run pipeline and create index
nodes = pipeline.run(documents=documents)
index = VectorStoreIndex(nodes)
🧠 What's Happening Behind the Scenes
Suppose your document is:

nginx
Copy
Edit
Sentence 1. Sentence 2. Sentence 3. Sentence 4. Sentence 5.
Without automerging:

Each sentence might become one node.

With automerging:

Sentences are merged into larger chunks like:

Node 1: Sentence 1 + 2 + 3

Node 2: Sentence 4 + 5

...based on the chunk_size and chunk_overlap values.

🔍 Key Parameters
chunk_size: Max tokens per merged node.

chunk_overlap: Tokens overlapped between merged nodes (for context).

automerge=True: Enables the merging behavior.

✅ Benefits of Automerging
Fewer chunks = better performance during search.

Keeps semantically related content together.

Saves on embedding and retrieval cost.

AutoMerging vs Parent-Child Relationship
----------------------
f  5 leaf node attached to the particular parent node, if 4 leaf node retreives, then it will retrieve the parent node, and another case, if we retrieve only 2 leaf node, it will not merge ?


ChatGPT said:
Great question — you're asking about how retrieval and merging relate in LlamaIndex, especially regarding parent-child (leaf-parent) relationships and when a parent node is retrieved based on the number of leaf nodes matched.

Let’s clarify the difference between Automerging and Parent-Child Retrieval — these are two different concepts, and I’ll answer both parts of your question clearly:

🔀 1. Automerging ≠ Parent-Child Relationship
Automerging happens during ingestion: it merges multiple small chunks into one based on token size and optionally semantic cohesion.

Parent-Child Retrieval (aka Composable Graphs) is different — it’s about hierarchical document structures (e.g., chapters ➜ paragraphs ➜ sentences).

So let’s now focus on your example, which seems more related to Parent-Child Retrieval logic.

📚 Parent-Child Retrieval Scenario
Suppose you have:

1 Parent Node (e.g., a section or a heading)

5 Leaf Nodes (e.g., sentences or paragraphs under that section)

Now let's consider:

✅ Case 1: 4 out of 5 Leaf Nodes Match a Query
In LlamaIndex's Parent-Child Retrieval, if many leaf nodes under the same parent are retrieved (e.g., 4 out of 5):

✅ The parent node will likely be retrieved or promoted because:

The retrieval system sees a strong match among child nodes.

It uses this signal to promote the parent node to provide higher-level context.

This is often used in TreeIndex or ComposableGraph where parent nodes are summaries of children.

❌ Case 2: Only 2 out of 5 Leaf Nodes Match
If only a few child nodes match (e.g., 2 out of 5):

The system might only return those 2 leaf nodes.

It might not promote the parent, because the overall section (parent) doesn't seem as relevant.

So the parent node is not retrieved unless the query strongly aligns with a majority of its children or with the parent summary itself.

🔁 Summary Table
# of Matching Leaf Nodes	Parent Node Retrieved?
4 out of 5	✅ Likely Yes
2 out of 5	❌ Probably Not

⚙️ Important Configs
This behavior is influenced by the retriever settings:

ParentNodeRetriever

Similarity thresholds

Retriever top-k settings

If you're using a custom retriever or graph retriever, you can control whether and how parent nodes are promoted.

Bonus: Automerging During Retrieval?
No — automerge only affects ingestion, not retrieval. It doesn't dynamically merge nodes during retrieval time. If automerging was used at ingestion, then retrieval happens on the merged nodes directly.

Would you like a visual diagram or code example for this parent-child scenario?

Great! You're diving into advanced LlamaIndex concepts:

🔹 Hierarchical Node Parsing

🔹 Automerge and its effect on retrieval

Let’s break down both clearly, with conceptual explanation and practical examples.

📘 1. Hierarchical Node Parser in LlamaIndex
💡 What Is It?
A HierarchicalNodeParser builds a multi-level structure (like a tree) from your documents — for example:

scss
Copy
Edit
Document
├── Section (Parent Node)
│   ├── Paragraph (Child Node)
│   │   └── Sentence (Leaf Node)
It splits your document into different levels of abstraction:

Root / Parent: Could be sections or chapters

Child: Paragraphs or smaller sections

Leaf Nodes: Sentences or smaller chunks

✅ Why Use It?
Gives more structured retrieval.

Supports context-aware answers: You can retrieve both a fine-grained sentence and its section summary.

Useful for long-form QA or multi-turn chat.

🛠️ Example Code
python
Copy
Edit
from llama_index.node_parser import HierarchicalNodeParser

# Create the hierarchical parser
parser = HierarchicalNodeParser.from_defaults(
    chunk_sizes=[1024, 512, 128],  # Hierarchical levels (top -> bottom)
    chunk_overlap=20
)

nodes = parser.get_nodes_from_documents(documents)
This produces a set of nodes across 3 levels:

Large section chunks (1024 tokens)

Mid-sized chunks (512 tokens)

Fine-grained small chunks (128 tokens)

These are linked in a tree-like hierarchy.

📗 2. Automerging in Retrieval — Clarification
⚠️ Important Distinction:
Automerge happens only during ingestion.

Retrieval uses pre-merged nodes. There is no merging at retrieval time.

So, when you use SentenceSplitter(automerge=True) or hierarchical parsing with chunk_sizes, you are deciding how big and coherent each node is during indexing, not retrieval.

🔍 Retrieval with Hierarchical Nodes
When you retrieve using a hierarchical index, you can choose:

✅ Option 1: Retrieve Leaf Nodes
Most accurate, fine-grained context

Good for pinpoint answers

✅ Option 2: Retrieve Parent Nodes
Better for summarization, chat, or high-level answers

You can use ParentNodeRetriever or a ComposableGraphRetriever to combine child + parent retrieval.

🧠 Retrieval Behavior (Conceptual)
Let’s say you queried something that matches two sentences (leaf nodes). You can configure retrieval to:

Return just the matching leaf nodes

Return their parent section node(s) (for context)

Return a mix of both, weighted by relevance

🧪 Example with Retrieval
python
Copy
Edit
from llama_index.indices.composability import ComposableGraph
from llama_index.retrievers import ParentNodeRetriever
from llama_index import VectorStoreIndex

# Build base vector index
leaf_index = VectorStoreIndex(leaf_nodes)

# Now wrap in composable structure
graph = ComposableGraph.from_indices([leaf_index], index_summaries=["Section summaries"])

# Parent retriever
retriever = ParentNodeRetriever(index=graph)

# Run query
response = retriever.retrieve("What is the project objective?")
This will return:

Relevant leaf nodes for accuracy

Their parent summaries for context

🔁 Summary: Automerging vs. Hierarchical Parsing
Feature	When It Happens	What It Does	Used For
Automerging	During ingestion	Merges semantically adjacent chunks	Fewer, larger, coherent chunks
HierarchicalNodeParser	During ingestion	Builds multi-level node structure	Structured, flexible retrieval
Retrieval (Hierarchical)	During query	Can return leaf, parent, or both nodes	Fine-grained + context-aware QA
