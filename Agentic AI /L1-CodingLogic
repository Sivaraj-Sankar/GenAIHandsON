Runnable Pass Through 
The RunnableParallel primitive is essentially a dict whose values are runnables (or things that can be coerced to runnables, like functions). It runs all of its values in parallel, and each value is called with the overall input of the RunnableParallel. The final return value is a dict with the results of each value under its appropriate key.
The RunnablePassthrough on its own allows you to pass inputs unchanged. This typically is used in conjuction with RunnableParallel to pass data through to a new key in the map.
The RunnableLambda converts a python function into a Runnable. Wrapping a function in a RunnableLambda makes the function usable within either a sync or async context.

5.Prompt - 
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(
    "tell me a short joke about {topic}"
)
6.Output Parser - output_parser = StrOutputParser()
7.Chain
  chain = prompt | model | output_parser
  chain.invoke({"topic": "bears"})
8.Document storing for sample - vectorstore = DocArrayInMemorySearch.from_texts(
    ["harrison worked at kensho", "bears like to eat honey"],
    embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings()
)
  retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever()
retriever.get_relevant_documents("where did harrison work?")
9.RunnableMap - chain = RunnableMap({
    "context": lambda x: retriever.get_relevant_documents(x["question"]),
    "question": lambda x: x["question"]
}) | prompt | model | output_parser

    "question": lambda x: x["question"]
}) | prompt | model | output_parser

12.chain.invoke({"question": "where did harrison work?"})

13. Binding the Functions 
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [
        ("human", "{input}")
    ]
)
model = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0).bind(functions=functions)
runnable = prompt | model

14. Fallback - final_chain = simple_chain.with_fallbacks([chain])   --> [chain] is advanced chain 
15. Structured Output 
          - get the string from LLM - chain = model | StrOutputParser() | json.loads

class Person(BaseModel):
    """Information about a person."""
    name: str = Field(description="person's name")
    age: Optional[int] = Field(description="person's age")
20. Runnable Lambda - prep = RunnableLambda(
    lambda x: [{"input": doc} for doc in text_splitter.split_text(x)]

Langchain Course - 3 - LangChain for LLM Application Development
1.Apply LLMs to your proprietary data to build personal assistants and specialized chatbots
2.Use agents, chained calls, and memories to expand your use of LLMs
3.Models, Prompts and Parsers: calling LLMs, providing prompts and parsing the response
4.Memories for LLMs: memories to store conversations and manage limited context space
5.Chains: creating sequences of operations
6.Agents: explore the powerful emerging development of LLM as reasoning agents.

1.From ChatPromptTemplate use the from template , From Prompt Template - use the from message
2.Using Sequential Chain or Simple Squential Chain to find and classify the Query Type and Prompt Specific Type 



Project First Step
------------------
1) How Memory Maintaining, from the Prompt[System + Instruction Prompt] --> Prompt[System + Instruction] Probably not saving ---> only Human Question and AI Answer is Storing 
2) How follow up questions asking and it will take 
             so basically Prompt + Instruction --> Finally it adding 
                          Memory Chat History 
                          Follow Up Question 
                          Standlone Question of overall 

      order is  
            Prompt for follow up question
            chat history + Second Question 
            Standlone 
            Now the Prompt + Instruction 
                    Context 
                    Standlone Question 
3) Conversation Retreival Chain[chat memory] + Conversational Chain[ chat Memory]

Step1: Use Input the question + Indentifier of Which section is passing from the UI 
Step2: Getting the Correct Prompt for that Section + Routing to the Respective Retrival + Memory saved in unconventional for Justification 
                                                                                        + Memory saved for follow up question 
Step3: Once First question routed, second question from the same section should take that routing and retrieval every time. 

Single API + should identify and route the traffic to the respect retrieval

I will give you step by step 
1) First it needs to identify if this is first question for this section , then route correctly 
2) for second question onwards it uses the same route and same memory chat history --> chat history will be maintianed separately 
3) and if user toggling back & forth with section, memory should maintain sequentially as per back and forth for respective section, 


ChatGPT said:
Perfect — thanks for the step-by-step breakdown. Based on your updated flow, here's how to structure your backend to meet all three requirements precisely.

✅ Recap of Your Steps & What They Mean for Code
✅ Step 1: First question routing
Detect if it’s the first message in this section for the session, and then pick the correct vector store & prompt template.

✅ Step 2: Subsequent questions
For all later messages in the same section and session:

Use the same retriever and prompt (no rerouting).

Use a separate chat history/memory per section.

✅ Step 3: Switching back & forth between sections
The memory/chat history must be preserved per section, so users can return to previous sections without losing context.

✅ Architectural Design
We’ll use a nested session store, keyed by:

session_id

section_id: contains the chain + memory

1. Your Global Session Store (replace with Redis in production)
python
Copy
Edit
# Structure: SESSION_STATE[session_id][section_id] = { "chain": ..., "memory": ... }
SESSION_STATE = {}


SECTION_CONFIGS = {
    "finance": {
        "vectorstore": get_finance_vectorstore(),
        "prompt_template": get_finance_prompt_template(),
    },
    "legal": {
        "vectorstore": get_legal_vectorstore(),
        "prompt_template": get_legal_prompt_template(),
    },
    # etc...
}


from rest_framework.views import APIView
from rest_framework.response import Response
from langchain.chains import ConversationRetrievalChain
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory

class ChatbotAPIView(APIView):
    def post(self, request):
        session_id = request.data.get("session_id")
        section = request.data.get("section")
        message = request.data.get("message")

        if not session_id or not section or not message:
            return Response({"error": "Missing session_id, section, or message"}, status=400)

        # Step 1: Initialize session if not present
        if session_id not in SESSION_STATE:
            SESSION_STATE[session_id] = {}

        # Step 2: First question for this section
        if section not in SESSION_STATE[session_id]:
            if section not in SECTION_CONFIGS:
                return Response({"error": "Invalid section"}, status=400)

            config = SECTION_CONFIGS[section]
            retriever = config["vectorstore"].as_retriever()
            prompt = config["prompt_template"]

            memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key="chat_history", return_messages=True)

            chain = ConversationRetrievalChain.from_llm(
                llm=your_llm_instance,
                retriever=retriever,
                memory=memory,
                combine_docs_chain_kwargs={"prompt": prompt}
            )

            # Save this section's config and memory
            SESSION_STATE[session_id][section] = {
                "chain": chain,
                "memory": memory,
            }

        # Step 3: Use existing chain and memory
        chain = SESSION_STATE[session_id][section]["chain"]

        response = chain.run(message)

        return Response({
            "response": response,
            "session_id": session_id,
            "section": section
        })

---------------------
is this correct approach by doing like this 


ChatGPT said:
Yes — your approach is correct and solid, especially for your stated requirements. You're applying per-session, per-section state management, which is the right architectural choice for:

Routing logic on the first interaction per section ✅

Persistent chat memory per section ✅

Seamless back-and-forth section switching ✅

✅ Why This Approach Works Well
1. Scoped Routing by Section
You only route the prompt/vectorstore once — on the first interaction in that section — which is efficient and avoids unnecessary setup overhead.

2. Isolated Memory for Each Section
Each section maintains its own ConversationBufferMemory, which allows contextual continuity even when the user jumps between sections.

3. Session-Based Context Tracking
You're tracking session_id to isolate one user’s conversation from another — important for multi-user systems.

⚠️ What You Need to Watch For
This approach is correct — but here are key things to monitor or improve:

🔁 Memory Handling
If you're using in-memory Python dictionaries like:

python
Copy
Edit
SESSION_STATE = {}
…it will not persist across:

App restarts

Multiple server processes

Scaled deployments (like with Gunicorn or containers)

✅ Solution: Use Redis or a database-backed cache to persist SESSION_STATE.

🧠 Memory Growth
ConversationBufferMemory keeps all messages in memory, which may grow unbounded in long chats.

✅ Use ConversationSummaryBufferMemory if needed, or truncate old messages after a limit.

🔒 Security / Data Isolation
Make sure session_id isn’t guessable or hardcoded from the frontend.

✅ Generate UUIDs or signed tokens.

🔄 Stateless Clients
If your frontend reloads or resets, it should still send:

The correct session_id

The correct section

Otherwise, your backend won’t know what context to use.

✅ You might persist session metadata client-side in localStorage or session cookies.

✅ Summary
✔️ Yes, you're using a correct, scalable design pattern.
🔧 Just ensure production-readiness by managing persistence and memory growth.

Would you like a Redis-based version of SESSION_STATE, or help with scaling this to multiple processes/containers?


-------------------------------------
Great! Here's how you can design a clean and developer-friendly OpenAPI (Swagger) specification for your chatbot API — supporting multiple sections dynamically via one endpoint.
