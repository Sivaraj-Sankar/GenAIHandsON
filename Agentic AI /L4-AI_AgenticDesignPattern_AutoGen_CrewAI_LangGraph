AI Agentic Desgin Pattern 
Pattern 1 - AI Agent will wait for Other AI Agent 
          - Delegate[Manager Agent, Orchestration Agent] the Task to other AI Agent 
          - Hierarchical Agent 
          - Workflow Agent 
Pattern 2 - ReAct Agent - Reflecting - Acting 
Pattern 3 - 


AI Agentic 
Workflow Pattern 
Autonomous Decision Making Pattern - with Tool Use
Personal Assistant Pattern - AI Assistant 
Real Person Memory Managing work async Pattern - and also send the work to other AI Agents 


AutoGen 
AutoGen framework to build multi-agent systems with diverse **roles and **capabilities for implementing complex AI applications.
**Reflection, Tool use, Planning, and Multi-agent collaboration using AutoGen.


AutoGen Agents Design Pattern 
ConversableAgent - Two Agent Chat 
sequence of chats between agents[multi-agent collaboration design pattern.] - Fun Collaboration customer onboarding 
A high-quality blog post by using the agent reflection framework. You’ll use the **“nested chat” structure to develop a system where reviewer agents, nested within a critic agent, reflect on the blog post written by another agent.
      critic agent 
          reviewer agent 
tool use design pattern - Agent 
Agents with coding capabilities to complete a financial analysis task. You’ll create two systems where agents collaborate and seek human feedback. The first system will generate code from scratch using an LLM, and the second will use user-provided code
A custom group chat with multiple agents that collaborate to generate a detailed stock performance report, incorporating a planning agent and customizing how the conversation flows between different agents.


1) Conversable Agent - Two Standup Comedian 
2) Multi Agent Collaboration - Sequence Chat - Craft the Task for sequential chat - to finish sequential dependent task 
3) Reflection Agent Pattern - Nested Agent Design Pattern 
4) Coding Agent  - seek human feedback - feeback loop getting from human 
5) Tool Use Agent - Chess Agent 
6) Custom Group Agent with multiple agents - customizing the conversational flow between different agents 
          Best Practices for Multi-Agent Group Chat 
  This Complex Task Requried Planning 
           Agent have to think, what sequence of task have to take 
            getting data, 
            analyzing  
            writing 
            revising 

Another interaction pattern - **Nested Chat - Which means when agent given a task and it calls bunch of other agents and iterates with them for a while before it returns the result 
  Blog Post Agent
  Chess Game 

------
Generate Reply - don't alter the internal state of the agent 
Initiate Chat - have memory state management 
Send - to re initiate the conversation

AutoGen Update [community-driven development approach - AG2]
To introduce significant architectural changes, including integration with Microsoft's broader AI ecosystem and tools like Semantic Kernel


AI Agent Definition 
   * Function Calling 
   * Effectively Tool Using 
   * Autonomously Making Decision 
   * Using Reasoning - Thinking - Observing - Act Over the Tool ---> Based on Environment - Perceiving 
   * Send Messages - Receive Messages - 
   * Generate Replies 
   * Interact with Other Agents
   * Perform Actions
   * Keeping the Human in the Loop 
   * stopping the response
   * Ask for human input before it generating the reply by LLM
