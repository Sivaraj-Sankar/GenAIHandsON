GRPO stands for Guided Reinforcement Preference Optimization, and it falls under the category of preference-based reinforcement learning used in fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) — specifically in alignment training.

🧠 GRPO: Where It Fits in LLM Training
LLMs are usually trained in three stages:

Pretraining

Massive unsupervised learning on internet-scale data using next-token prediction.

Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)

Models are trained on curated instruction-following datasets (e.g., question-answer pairs, human-written prompts/responses).

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) or Alternatives

This stage improves alignment with human preferences.

🔁 GRPO in Stage 3: RLHF Alternatives
GRPO is a direct preference optimization method, conceptually similar to DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) and IPO (Implicit Preference Optimization). Here's how it compares:

Method	Training Type	Key Idea
RLHF (PPO)	Reinforcement Learning	Optimize policy via rewards based on human preferences
DPO	Supervised-style	Directly learn a scoring function from preferences
GRPO	Preference-based Reinforcement Learning	Uses guidance signals with RL to optimize for preferred behaviors more stably

🎯 What Makes GRPO Different?
Uses a reward function based on human preferences (like PPO), but introduces guidance to reduce variance and instability in training.

Aims to combine the stability of DPO with the flexibility of RL-based methods.

Think of it as a hybrid between PPO and DPO: reinforcement learning, but "guided" toward good outputs without the full complexity or instability of PPO.

✅ Summary
GRPO is part of the alignment training phase in LLMs.

It belongs to the preference-based reinforcement learning category.

It's used after supervised fine-tuning, to fine-tune models using human feedback or preference data.

Certainly! Let's dive deeply into RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) and the PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) algorithm used in its training process.

🔁 What is RLHF?
RLHF is a training method that improves a language model by aligning it with human preferences. It addresses limitations of supervised learning, where the model might learn only from static examples, not necessarily from what people prefer.

🧠 Why RLHF?
Pretrained models can be:

Unhelpful (give generic or irrelevant answers),

Unsafe (generate harmful content),

Untruthful (hallucinate facts).

RLHF aligns models with human values by training them to produce answers that people actually want to see.

🧱 Three-Stage Pipeline of RLHF
✅ 1. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
What happens? Start with a pretrained LLM (from self-supervised learning).

Training on: Human-annotated prompt-response pairs.

Goal: Teach the model how to answer tasks in general.

Output: A decent base model to bootstrap later stages.

Think of this like teaching the model to speak politely and answer questions reasonably well.

🏆 2. Reward Model (RM) Training
What happens? Train a reward model to score outputs.

Training data: Human-ranked outputs for the same prompt.

Example: Humans are shown 3 model completions and rank them: 1st, 2nd, 3rd.

Model type: Usually same architecture as the base LLM, but trained to predict a scalar reward score.

This model mimics human judgment and acts as a referee for what’s "good".

🎮 3. Reinforcement Learning (RL) with PPO
Goal: Improve the LLM's behavior based on the learned reward model.

Process: Generate new outputs, score them using the reward model, and adjust the policy (LLM) to maximize expected reward.

Algorithm used: PPO – Proximal Policy Optimization

🔍 Detailed PPO Workflow in RLHF
Here’s how PPO fits into training:

Step-by-step PPO in RLHF:
🧪 Step 1: Sample Outputs (Rollouts)
Pick a batch of prompts.

Generate several completions using the current model (the policy).

These are called rollouts.

🎯 Step 2: Get Reward Scores
Feed rollouts into the reward model.

Output is a scalar reward for each completion.

Example: "This answer is a 7.2 out of 10."

🧮 Step 3: Compute Advantage
Measure how much better each action (token) was compared to the average (called the advantage).

Also calculate the value function, estimating expected future reward.

🔁 Step 4: Policy Update (PPO)
PPO updates the model weights to:

Encourage tokens that led to high-reward outputs,

Discourage tokens that led to poor ones.

PPO uses a clipped objective to prevent large updates:

This ensures stable and conservative updates.

🧰 Step 5: Repeat
Do this over many iterations.

Continue generating new responses, scoring with the RM, and updating the LLM policy via PPO.
