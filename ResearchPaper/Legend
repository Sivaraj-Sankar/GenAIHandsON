GRPO stands for Guided Reinforcement Preference Optimization, and it falls under the category of preference-based reinforcement learning used in fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) ‚Äî specifically in alignment training.

üß† GRPO: Where It Fits in LLM Training
LLMs are usually trained in three stages:

Pretraining

Massive unsupervised learning on internet-scale data using next-token prediction.

Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)

Models are trained on curated instruction-following datasets (e.g., question-answer pairs, human-written prompts/responses).

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) or Alternatives

This stage improves alignment with human preferences.

üîÅ GRPO in Stage 3: RLHF Alternatives
GRPO is a direct preference optimization method, conceptually similar to DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) and IPO (Implicit Preference Optimization). Here's how it compares:

Method	Training Type	Key Idea
RLHF (PPO)	Reinforcement Learning	Optimize policy via rewards based on human preferences
DPO	Supervised-style	Directly learn a scoring function from preferences
GRPO	Preference-based Reinforcement Learning	Uses guidance signals with RL to optimize for preferred behaviors more stably

üéØ What Makes GRPO Different?
Uses a reward function based on human preferences (like PPO), but introduces guidance to reduce variance and instability in training.

Aims to combine the stability of DPO with the flexibility of RL-based methods.

Think of it as a hybrid between PPO and DPO: reinforcement learning, but "guided" toward good outputs without the full complexity or instability of PPO.

‚úÖ Summary
GRPO is part of the alignment training phase in LLMs.

It belongs to the preference-based reinforcement learning category.

It's used after supervised fine-tuning, to fine-tune models using human feedback or preference data.

Would you like a comparison of GRPO vs PPO vs DPO in terms of stability, sample efficiency, or implementation complexity?


 Post-Training (a.k.a. Fine-Tuning)
This is where general-purpose LLMs are made safe, helpful, and aligned with user intentions or specific tasks.

üöÄ Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
Method	Description
Instruction Tuning	Train on curated examples that teach the model to follow instructions.
Task-Specific Fine-Tuning	Fine-tune on a narrow task (e.g., summarization, coding).
Chain-of-Thought Fine-Tuning	Add intermediate reasoning steps to answers to teach step-by-step thinking.

ü§ñ Reinforcement and Preference-Based Alignment
Method	Description
RLHF (PPO)	Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (OpenAI used this for InstructGPT, ChatGPT).
DPO (Direct Preference Optimization)	A supervised-style method using human preferences instead of rewards.
GRPO (Guided Reinforcement Preference Optimization)	A hybrid of PPO and DPO ‚Äî reinforcement learning guided by preferences.
RLAIF (RL from AI Feedback)	Replace humans with LLMs to generate preference data.
IPO (Implicit Preference Optimization)	Learns preference alignment without explicit reward modeling.

üß™ Other Specialized Post-Training Techniques
Method	Purpose
LoRA / QLoRA	Low-rank fine-tuning methods to save memory and training costs.
Adapters / Prefix Tuning	Add lightweight layers or tokens for domain-specific tasks.
Distillation	Teach a smaller student model using a larger teacher model.
Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning	Fine-tune models to work with external knowledge sources.
Multimodal Fine-Tuning	Tune the model to work with images, audio, or video along with text.
