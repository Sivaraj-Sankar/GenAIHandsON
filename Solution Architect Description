Layer 1
   1. Internal User (Bank Employee/RM) - RM, Underwriter, Credit Analyst
   2. Identity Provider - Provides role-based access to different sections of the app
   3. Django + React App Gateway - Secure HTTPS entry point
                        - Routes requests to different analysis modules 
                        - Allows modular section access based on RBAC
                        - Optional: Include Azure WAF if required
            Gateway routes to the modular UI (each section like Financials, Risk, Management, etc.)
   4. Private DNS Zones - Required if you want private endpoint access for internal services (e.g., LLMs or storage)

   Layer 1.1  - 3
        1. Django - Azure Functions (background tasks)
        2. Azure Logic Apps (workflows for document ingestion / preprocessing)
        3. Azure Blob Storage (uploaded documents)

Private DNS Zone is an Azure-managed DNS service that resolves domain names privately inside your Virtual Network (VNet) — especially when you’re using Private Endpoints.
When you create a Private Endpoint for an Azure PaaS service (like Azure App Service, Storage, OpenAI, etc.), it gets a private IP inside your VNet.
But DNS (domain name resolution) still needs to resolve the service name (e.g., myapp.azurewebsites.net) to that private IP — otherwise, traffic will go to the public internet address.
Private DNS Zones solve this by:

Overriding the default public DNS.

Resolving the name to the private IP address instead.

Ensuring traffic stays inside the Azure network, not over the public internet.

Doubts
1. What is Application Gateway Subnet - with Azure Web Application Firewall
2. Gateway routes to the modular UI (each section like Financials, Risk, Management, etc.) - How, 
           Either by Azure API Management 
3. If I have the Gateway in App Service, and also have App Service instance in the Zone 1, Zone2, Zone3 --> How it will automatically scale-out
