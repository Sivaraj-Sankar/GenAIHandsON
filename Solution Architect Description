Layer 1
   1. Internal User (Bank Employee/RM) - RM, Underwriter, Credit Analyst
   2. Identity Provider - Provides role-based access to different sections of the app
   3. Django + React App Gateway - Secure HTTPS entry point
                        - Routes requests to different analysis modules 
                        - Allows modular section access based on RBAC
                        - Optional: Include Azure WAF if required
            Gateway routes to the modular UI (each section like Financials, Risk, Management, etc.)
   4. Private DNS Zones - Required if you want private endpoint access for internal services (e.g., LLMs or storage)

   Layer 1.1  - 3
        1. Django - Azure Functions (background tasks)
        2. Azure Logic Apps (workflows for document ingestion / preprocessing)
        3. Azure Blob Storage (uploaded documents)


Deploying in Azure Virtual Network

Doubts
1. What is Application Gateway Subnet - with Azure Web Application Firewall
2. Gateway routes to the modular UI (each section like Financials, Risk, Management, etc.) - How, 
           Either by Azure API Management 
3. If I have the Gateway in App Service, and also have App Service instance in the Zone 1, Zone2, Zone3 --> How it will automatically scale-out
