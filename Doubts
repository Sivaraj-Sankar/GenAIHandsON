28) how Multi Agent are working so far I created in LangGraph and CrewAI - is it waiting for other agents to complete the work , are passing the task sequentially 
    In Letta - the Multi Agent Concept is different 

29) How to Pass the Tools name to the OpenAI Function Call 
       Function Definition - Pydantic Object to create the Function Definition
    How to create the Actual Python function tool --> whith doc string to --> for LLM to understand
