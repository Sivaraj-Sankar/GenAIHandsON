Agentic AI Design Pattern 
Generative AI Design Pattern


Exploring the Foundations of AI-Augmented Architecture
1.You’ll learn common patterns, antipatterns, strategies, use cases, and more that you can employ immediately to harness the power of generative AI.
2.Design modern systems that work well with generative and agent-based AI
3.Understand where AI tools can add real value in software architecture—and where they can’t
4.Learn what to consider when using vector databases and other AI-era infrastructure
5.particularly code generation—and the impact of tool integration
6.He also covers memory architectures, from short-term recall to long-term persistence, as essential components of learning and context management
7.AI Tools in Micro-Frontend Architectures
8.practical guidance on designing and deploying intelligent systems using LLMs, based on real-world experience
9.Topics include fine-tuning, zero-shot learning, prompt engineering, and managing common integration challenges such as latency, tokenization, and safety.
10.Architecting for Vectors
11.explore the trade-offs between specialized vector stores and integrated approaches, emerging patterns in distributed systems, and how CockroachDB is addressing these challenges.
12.how to architect that system for production using event-driven microservices
13.explores agentic architecture in multi-agent AI systems, emphasizing the roles of controller, planner, and judge for intelligent coordination
14.She’ll also discuss building scalable, event-driven microservices with Kafka and Flink and highlight best practices for RAG pipelines, governance, and observability
15.It's not just about enhancing desktop applications with agentic functionality—it's about exposing reusable tools and resources (including real-time data from sources like Apache Kafka) to build agentic microservices
16.Tim describes how to go beyond basic LLM chatbots to dynamic, problem-solving systems that deliver real value in real professional settings.

Pitfalls
1.architects face mounting pressure to support vector search without compromising transactional guarantees
2. These demands are pushing legacy database architectures to their limits and prompting a reassessment of how to build for both scale and consistency
