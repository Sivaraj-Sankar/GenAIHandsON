SWE-Agent - 
1.SWE-agent—an autonomous software engineering agent designed to solve real-world programming issues. Here's a breakdown
2.SWE-agent is a system that enables a large language model (LLM)—such as GPT-4o or Claude Sonnet 4—to autonomously interact with a computer environment (e.g., navigating a GitHub repository, editing code, executing tests) to resolve coding issues. It acts through a structured Agent-Computer Interface (ACI) that handles context, actions, and feedback to enable effective decision-making

5.In the foundational 2024 research paper, SWE-agent achieved state-of-the-art results—resolving 12.5% of real-world GitHub issues (pass@1) on the SWE-bench dataset, outperforming prior non-interactive approaches

SWE Bench 
1.SWE-bench (Software Engineering Benchmark) is the evaluation framework behind SWE-agent. It's a set of real-world software engineering tasks created from actual GitHub issues across Python codebases—each task requires the agent to generate a patch that fixes the issue and doesn’t break existing functionality

It includes different variants:
Full: ~2,294 issues (original dataset)
Lite: A lighter subset with ~300 curated instances
Verified: A high-quality subset of ~500 samples with clarity and reliable testing, introduced via collaboration with OpenAI
4.SWE-bench is notable for its realistic complexity, requiring codebase navigation, multi-file reasoning, execution environment manipulation, and more

Evolution of SWE-agent & Benchmark Performance
Recent developments have significantly improved SWE-agent performance:
Mini-SWE-Agent: Achieved ~65% on SWE-bench Verified with just 100 lines of Python code
