Coding Agents 
-------------
1.Use sub-agents for complex tasks: Instead of one monolithic prompt, decompose the problem. Use specialized prompts for sub-tasks like planning, identifying relevant files, and then generating the code.
2.Use intentional compaction: Actively manage and shrink your context to keep the agent focused on what's most important.
3.Align language and naming: Use consistent naming conventions across your codebase to make it easier for the AI to understand the relationships between different parts.
4.Review markdown docs to catch problems BEFORE implementation: Review the research and plan the agent creates to foster mental alignment and ensure it's on the right track.
5.Practice exploratory coding: Work alongside your agent to build your own intuition and spot where the AI excels and where it needs guidance.
6.CLAUDE.md > prompts > research > plans > implementation: Focus human effort on the highest-leverage parts of the pipeline.


Phase 1 - Research:
Phase 2 - Planning:
Phase 3 - Implementation:

Prompting and Contexting
Context engineering isn't just about cramming more stuff into the prompt; it's a deliberate practice of structuring, compacting, and aligning information to make your AI agent a more effective partner.

Prompting Pattern 
Self-Regulation/Meta-Cognition Pattern
Agentic Behavior Control Pattern 


Different Agentic Design Pattern [Prompting Strategies, Reasoning Frameworks that structure the model's 
Thought process, decision-making, action-execution behavior.]
-------------------------------------------------------------
CoT Pattern  - Let's think step-by-step [break down complex reasoning into logical steps]
               Math Problems, Reasoning questions, planning tasks
ReAct Pattern - Reason + Act - Combines CoT with tool usage 
                Thought 
                Action 
                Observation
         Interleaves reasoning with calling external tools or APIs
         Web Q&A agents, search-based assistants, RAG Agents.
Plan-and-Solve (PaS) - First create a high-level plan and execute 
      Complex Tasks that benefit from high-level planning (coding, multi-part answers)
Self-Ask-With-Search - 
      Pattern: LLM asks itself follow-up questions and uses tools to answer them. 
      Purpose: Encourages decomposing hard questions into smaller searchable ones. 
      UseCase: Open-domain Q&A with access to web search or tools. 
OODA Pattern: Observe-Orient-Decide-Act 
      Pattern: Agent Loops through 
             Observe (input/environment) 
             Orient  (analyze context/goals) 
             Decide  (Choose next action) 
             Act     (perform the action/tool call)
       Purpose: Continuous adaptive decision-making, inspired by military strategy. 
       Use Case: Autonomous Agents, Real-Time systems, cyber defense. 
Self-Regulation/Meta-Cognition Patterns
6.Reflexion 
         Pattern - Agent Generates Output - evaluates its own mistakes - retries 
         Purpose - Self-Critique and iterative refinement 
         Use Case - Coding Agents, Multi-Step Planning, Error-Prone Reasoning 
7. Tree of Thought 
        Pattern: Agent Explores multiple reasoning paths (like a search tree). 
        Purpose: Decision-making under uncertainty by branching possible solutions. 
        Use Case: Puzzle solving, reasoning over conflicting information.
8. DEPS (Decompose-Execute-Plan-Self-Reflect) 
        Purpose: Modularize Complex tasks using decomposition, execution, planning, and reflection.
        Use Case: Long-Term Planning, autonomous task solving. 
9. Auto-CoT (Automatic Chain-of-Thought)
        Pattern: Automatically generate multiple reasoning paths from examples or few-shots. 
        Use Case: Scaling CoT to new domains without handcrafted examples. 

10. Verify and Revise 
        Pattern: Generative initial output - very correctness - revise if needed 
        Use Case: Document Drafting, coding, compliance checks.

Agentic Behaivor Control Patterns 
11. Task Decomposition + Sub-Agent Delegation
    Pattern: Main Agent Decomposes task -> assigns subtasks to specialized agents.
    Use Case: Agent Swarms, Complex Workflows, multi-agent simulations. 

12. Goal Reflection + Planning
    Pattern: Reflect on current goal status + revise plan or subgoals. 
    Use Case: Iterative Planning agents like AutoGPT/BabyAGI. 
13. Toolformer Pattern  
    Pattern: Self-Supervised Learning of When to use tools via LLM-generated annotations. 
    Use Case: Agents that learn tool-use policies over time. 
14. MRKL (Modular Reasoning, knowledge & Language) 
    Pattern: LLM routes queries to appropriate expert modules ( calculator, database. etc) 
    UseCase: Knowledge routing, structured tool use, modular agent design. 
Special Purpose Prompting Patterns. 
15. Consitutional AI 
      Pattern: Uses a "constitution" (ruleset or values) to guide or critique agent behavior. 
      Use Case: Safety alignment, ethical reasoning, moderation. 
16. Multi-Perspective Prompting 
      Pattern: Generate answers from multiple personas/roles - aggregate or compare
      UseCase: Decision Support, Brainstorming, ethical dilemmas. 
17. Inner Monologue
      Pattern: Agent narrates its reasoning before taking action. 
      Use Case: Debugging, transparency, trustworthiness in agent output. 

Agent Adaptive Loop 
TC2 (Tool Use + CoT + Critique) - integrates CoT, ReAct Style tool use, and Reflection loops for multiple iterations of improvement. 
Modern Tool Use/Context-Aware Orchestration
AutoPDL - Auto-Prompt Design Language - Meta-ML approach to automatically discover optimal agentic prompt configurations. 
                                        exploring combinations of CoT, ReAct, Reflection etc. across LLMs and tasks via structured search.
