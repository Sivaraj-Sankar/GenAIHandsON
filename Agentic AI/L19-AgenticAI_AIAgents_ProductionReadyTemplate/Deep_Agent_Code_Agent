Multi-Agent Research System 

User -- Reuqest -->
                           Scope --- Brief --> Research -- Findings --> Write --> Report
     <-- Clarification --

1.Multi Agent Architecture 
2.Prompting Techniques [like adding thinking steps that improve performance]
3.Built in persistence layer is great for tracking the progress of multiple agents that are recording results from the research over a 
  long time period. 
4.LangSmith for observability and evaluation, giving you detailed visibility into our long-running agent.
5.LangSmith also lets you test and monitor components of the agents as you develop and deploy them 
6.Supervisor agent to manage multiple research agents. 




Produce comprehensive reports using various sources of context

Research itself is a great use case for agents. 
Since Topic & Source aren't known ahead of time. the application requires a high level of agency and decision making
