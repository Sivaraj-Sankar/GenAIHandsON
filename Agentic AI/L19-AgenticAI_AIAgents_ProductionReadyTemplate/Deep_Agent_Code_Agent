Deep Agent
----------
Build your own deep research agent to handle research tasks.
Learn how to use LangGraph to build a multi-agent system.
Use LangSmith to evaluate its performance.

Agenda
Research Agent
Research Agent with MCP 
Research Supervisor 
Multi-Agent Research System 

User -- Reuqest -->
                           Scope --- Brief --> Research -- Findings --> Write --> Report
     <-- Clarification --

1.Multi Agent Architecture 
2.Prompting Techniques [like adding thinking steps that improve performance]
3.Built in persistence layer is great for tracking the progress of multiple agents that are recording results from the research over a 
  long time period. 
4.LangSmith for observability and evaluation, giving you detailed visibility into our long-running agent.
5.LangSmith also lets you test and monitor components of the agents as you develop and deploy them 
6.Supervisor agent to manage multiple research agents. 




Produce comprehensive reports using various sources of context

Research itself is a great use case for agents. 
Since Topic & Source aren't known ahead of time. the application requires a high level of agency and decision making 

1.Research is an open-ended task; the best strategy to answer a user request can’t be easily known in advance
2.Requests can require different research strategies and varying levels of search depth.
3.Open deep research uses an agent to conduct research as part of a three step process:

Scope – clarify research scope
Research – perform research
Write – produce the final report

1. User Clarification and Brief Generation 
Purpose: Clarify research scope and transform user input into structured research briefs
User Clarification: Determines if additional context is needed from the user using structured output
Brief Generation: Transforms conversations into detailed research questions
LangGraph Commands: Using Command system for flow control and state updates
Structured Output: Pydantic schemas for reliable decision making
**What You'll Learn: State management, structured output patterns, conditional routing

2. Research Agent with Custom Tools
Purpose: Build an iterative research agent using external search tools
Agent Architecture: LLM decision node + tool execution node pattern
Sequential Tool Execution: Reliable synchronous tool execution
Search Integration: Tavily search with content summarization
Tool Execution: ReAct-style agent loop with tool calling
**Content summarization to compress search results
**Iterative research loop with conditional routing
**Rich prompt engineering for comprehensive research

**What You'll Learn: Agent patterns, tool integration, search optimization, research workflow design

3. Research Agent with MCP (notebooks/3_research_agent_mcp.ipynb)
Purpose: Integrate Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers as research tools
Model Context Protocol: Standardized protocol for AI tool access
MCP Architecture: Client-server communication via stdio/HTTP
LangChain MCP Adapters: Seamless integration of MCP servers as LangChain tools
Local vs Remote MCP: Understanding transport mechanisms

MultiServerMCPClient for managing MCP servers
Configuration-driven server setup (filesystem example)
Rich formatting for tool output display
Async tool execution required by MCP protocol (no nested event loops needed)

**What You'll Learn: MCP integration, client-server architecture, protocol-based tool access

4. Research Supervisor
Purpose: Multi-agent coordination for complex research tasks
Supervisor Pattern: Coordination agent + worker agents
Parallel Research: Concurrent research agents for independent topics using parallel tool calls
Research Delegation: Structured tools for task assignment
Context Isolation: Separate context windows for different research topics

**Two-node supervisor pattern (supervisor + supervisor_tools)
Parallel research execution using asyncio.gather() for true concurrency
Structured tools (ConductResearch, ResearchComplete) for delegation
Enhanced prompts with parallel research instructions
Comprehensive documentation of research aggregation patterns

**What You'll Learn: Multi-agent patterns, parallel processing, research coordination, async orchestration

5. Full Multi-Agent Research System
Purpose: Complete end-to-end research system integrating all components
Three-Phase Architecture: Scope → Research → Write
System Integration: Combining scoping, multi-agent research, and report generation
State Management: Complex state flow across subgraphs
End-to-End Workflow: From user input to final research report

Complete workflow integration with proper state transitions
Supervisor and researcher subgraphs with output schemas
Final report generation with research synthesis
Thread-based conversation management for clarification

**What You'll Learn: System architecture, subgraph composition, end-to-end workflows

Key Learning Outcomes

Structured Output: Using Pydantic schemas for reliable AI decision making
Async Orchestration: Strategic use of async patterns for parallel coordination vs synchronous simplicity
Agent Patterns: ReAct loops, supervisor patterns, multi-agent coordination
Search Integration: External APIs, MCP servers, content processing
Workflow Design: LangGraph patterns for complex multi-step processes
State Management: Complex state flows across subgraphs and nodes
Protocol Integration: MCP servers and tool ecosystems




Deep Agent - Planning Agent 
--------------------------
Complex 
Long Running 
Operate Complex Task over long time horizon

Task planning (e.g., todo), often with recitation
Context offloading to file systems
Context isolation through sub-agent delegation

Planning 
File System 
Sub Agents 
Prompting 


1.Create Agent 
2.Todo Lists
3.Files 
4.SubAgents

key Points
1. LLM Agent can interact with all our computing infrastructure. 
2. Anthropic Claude Code is a long Running Agent. and OpenAI's Deep Research 
3. Agent Will lose their way over long sequences.
