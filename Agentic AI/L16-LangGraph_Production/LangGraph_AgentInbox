LangGraph - Agent Inbox
-----------------------
-just needs to have an interrupt event 
-which passes in a specific schema which we have outlined in the github readme 
-once that interrupt is triggered the agent inbox can use the langgraph SDK to fetch those interrupt items and since it's using that specific schema 
-we know exactly what fields to render and say the description 
-Any langraph app as long as it uses the specific human interrupt schema
-Human Interrupt Schema - To Implement this in your langgraph graph 
 human interrupt for the agent inbox
- Example in python and how you we can implement this and the same goes for JS it'll simply define your human interrupt object pass it to the 
interrupt function and then once the graph is resumed it will return the human response value

Front End Hooks [Each hook gives your component a ‚Äúsuperpower‚Äù to do something beyond just showing static content]
---------------
See whether the lamp is ON/OFF
Toggle the lamp on or off
Auto-dim at night
Share lamp state with other devices in the house

useState ‚Üí Remembering the Lamp‚Äôs State
Without state, every time you refresh the app, it forgets.
So useState is like the lamp‚Äôs memory inside the app.

useEffect ‚Üí Side Effects, like Auto-Dimming
The app checks the time: if it‚Äôs night, the lamp dims automatically.
That‚Äôs not about the UI itself‚Äîit‚Äôs a side effect that runs after the app has updated.
Example: At 7PM ‚Üí app triggers auto-dim.


Custom Hook ‚Üí Reusable Logic
Imagine you also have a smart fan app. It needs the same ‚Äúauto-dim at night‚Äù logic
Instead of rewriting the same time-checking code, you make a custom hook called useNightMode
Now both the lamp and the fan can reuse that logic
Example: Both devices know it‚Äôs nighttime without duplicating logic

useContext ‚Üí Sharing Lamp State Across Devices
Your phone, tablet, and smart speaker should all stay in sync about whether the lamp is ON/OFF.
useContext lets them share this ‚Äúglobal‚Äù state without each one having to re-check separately.
Example: If you say ‚ÄúHey Alexa, turn off lamp‚Äù, your phone app also shows ‚ÄúLamp is OFF.‚Äù


useReducer ‚Üí Complex Controls
Imagine the lamp has multiple modes: ON, OFF, DIM, COLOR CHANGE
Managing these with plain useState could get messy
useReducer acts like a remote control system, where each button press is an action that updates the lamp‚Äôs mode.
Example: Press ‚ÄúDIM‚Äù button ‚Üí state changes from ON ‚Üí DIM.

Hooks are like smart home gadgets that give your app the ability to remember things, react to changes, share state, and handle complex logic‚Äîall inside simple functional components.


How Next.js is useful in React + TypeScript projects

Next.js is a React framework that provides features you don‚Äôt get in plain React. With TypeScript, it becomes even more powerful for building production-ready apps.

Next.js 
-------
File-based Routing
No need to install react-router. Just create files in /pages and Next.js handles routing automatically.

Server-Side Rendering (SSR) & Static Site Generation (SSG)
Improves performance and SEO compared to client-side only React.

API Routes
You can create backend endpoints directly inside your Next.js app under /pages/api.

Built-in TypeScript Support
Just add a tsconfig.json and Next.js configures TypeScript for you.

Image Optimization
The <Image /> component optimizes images automatically.

Full-stack capabilities
Since you can have frontend + backend (API routes) in one project.
üîπ Example: Instead of just a client-only React app, with Next.js + TypeScript you can build:
A blog (static pages + markdown)
An e-commerce app (server-rendered product pages + APIs)
A dashboard (SSG for speed + SSR for user-specific data)
