Multimodal RAG: Chat with Videos

Explore the concept of multimodal semantic space and its importance in AI
Semantic - relating to meaning in language or logic.
Learn the differences between traditional RAG and multimodal RAG systems, focusing on the complexities of integrating different models
**Querying video content using multimodal AI
**You will understand and use a multimodal embedding model to embed images and captions in a **multimodal semantic space
**Using that common space, you will build and use a retrieval system that returns images using text prompts
**You will use a **Large Vision Language Model (LVLM)** to generate a response using the images and text from the retrieval.
Advanced search engines that understand visual context, creating AI assistants capable of discussing video content
and building automated systems for video content analysis and summarization.

Looking to enhance content Management systems, 
                           Improve accessibility features, or 
                           Push the boundaries of human-AI interaction.

Model 
1) Native Multimodal 
2) Multimodal Embedding to capture the **multimodal semantic space 
3) Large Vision Language Model[LVLM] to generate a response using the images and text from the retrieval 
3) Multimodal Foundation Model 
4)   - Scaling up the model causes the vision and text representation aligns with each other 

RAG Architecture 
1) Understand the architecture of multimodal RAG systems and interact with a Gradio app demonstrating multimodal video chat capabilities.
2) Multimodal Embedding with BridgeTower: Explore the BridgeTower model to create joint embeddings for image-caption pairs, measure similarities, and visualize high-dimensional embeddings
3) Video Pre-processing for Multimodal RAG: Learn to extract frames and transcripts from videos, generate transcriptions using the Whisper model, and create captions using Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs).
4) Building a Multimodal Vector Database: Implement multimodal retrieval using LanceDB and LangChain, performing similarity searches on multimodal data.
5) Leveraging Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs): Understand the architecture of LVLMs like LLaVA and implement image captioning, visual question answering, and multi-turn conversations.

Project Step by Step 
Hands-on project
Throughout the course, youâ€™ll build a complete multimodal RAG system that:

1)Processes and embeds video content (frames, transcripts, and captions)
2)Stores multimodal data in a vector database
3)Retrieves relevant video segments given text queries
4)Generates contextual responses using LVLMs
5)Maintains multi-turn conversations about video content
