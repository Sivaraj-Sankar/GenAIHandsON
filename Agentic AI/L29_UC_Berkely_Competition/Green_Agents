1.AgentBeats provides a prompt-based toolkit to help developers
quickly spin up a prototype green agent, making it easy to get started
2.For more rigorous or complex testing—say, strict workflows or custom
environments—developers can also hand-code the logic of a green
agent. 
3.Ultimately, as long as it complies with the A2A protocol, any web
service can serve as a green agent

Type 1
Goal: Adapt an existing benchmark (already published/tested) and
integrate as a green agent in AgentBeats
– E.g. SWE-bench Verified, Terminal bench
• Largely reuse existing evaluation metrics or rubrics

Drawbacks
Yet, as AI evolves toward agentic systems—AI agents capable of reasoning, taking actions, and interacting with the world—our current benchmarking methods for simple LLM model-level evaluation fall short:
Interoperability: Running a production-grade agent on existing benchmarks often feels like forcing a square peg into a round hole. Substantial modifications are needed just to make it fit.
Reproducibility: Stateful tools, memory, and dynamic configurations lead to results that can vary across runs, undermining consistency.
Fragmentation: There’s no single, unified view of progress—leaderboards and results are scattered across platforms and domains.
Discovery: With new benchmarks appearing almost weekly, finding the right one for a given goal can be surprisingly time-consuming.

Goals
Our vision for streamlined agentic AI evaluation is a unified space where the community can come together to define the goalposts of agentic AI—through benchmarks that are:
Compatible and Standardized: Any agent can connect to any benchmark with near-zero code changes.
Reproducible: Each run starts in the same state as any other.
Collaborative & Discoverable: A living hub where researchers, developers, and enthusiasts alike can easily find the most relevant benchmarks, identify top-performing agents, and collaboratively shape the standards that define the future of agentic AI.
