1.Each step responsible for handling certain event types and emitting new events.
2.T@step - his is used to infer the input and output types of each workflow for validation, and ensures each step only runs when an accepted event is ready.
3.Workflows are also automatically instrumented, so you get observability into each step using tools like Arize Pheonix
Build an agent, a RAG flow, an extraction flow, or anything else you want.

Events
Events are user-defined pydantic objects
You control the attributes and any other auxiliary methods
StartEvent signifies where to send the initial workflow input
StartEvent is a bit of a special object since it can hold arbitrary attributes
ev.topic, which would raise an error if it wasn't there. You could also do ev.get("topic")


Custom Start and Stop Event 
To use a custom start event, the first step is creating a custom class that inherits from StartEvent.
MyCustomStartEvent as event type in the steps that act as entry points
We could still pass the fields of MyCustomStartEvent as keyword arguments to the run method of our workflow, but that would be, again, cumbersome.
A better approach is to use pass the event instance through the start_event keyword argument like this

when we use StopEvent, the result of a workflow must be set to the result field of the event instance
Since a result can be any Python object, the result field of StopEvent is typed as Any
Additionally, returning more than one object is cumbersome: we usually stuff a bunch of unrelated objects into a dictionary that we then assign to StopEvent.result
when using a custom stop events, is that the result of a workflow run will be the instance of the event

Allows introspection from outer applications that now know exactly what a workflow run will return


Drawing Workflow 
Workflows can be visualized, using the power of type annotations in your step definitions
You can either draw all possible paths through the workflow, or the most recent execution, to help with debugging.


pip install llama-index-utils-workflow
from llama_index.utils.workflow import (
    draw_all_possible_flows,
    draw_most_recent_execution,
)

# Draw all
draw_all_possible_flows(JokeFlow, filename="joke_flow_all.html")
# Draw an execution
w = JokeFlow()
await w.run(topic="Pirates")
draw_most_recent_execution(w, filename="joke_flow_recent.html")




Working with Global Context/State
---------------------------------
you can choose to use global context between steps
For example, maybe multiple steps access the original query input from the user. You can store this in global context so that every step has access.

# retrieve from context
    query = await ctx.store.get("query")


Often, you'll have some preset shape that you want to use as the state for your workflow
The best way to do this is to use a Pydantic model to define the state. This way, you:
Get type hints for your state
Get automatic validation of your state
(Optionally) Have full control over the serialization and deserialization of your state using validators and serializers
You should use a pydantic model that has defaults for all fields. This enables the Context object to automatically initialize the state with the defaults


Example 
val = await ctx.store.get("key", default=<some_default_value>)

Alternatively, for atomic updates or multi-field state manipulation, you can use:
async with ctx.store.edit_state() as state:
    state["some_field"] = new_value

ctx.collect_events maintains a buffer of incoming events by type, orderly retrieving them when all prerequisites are met
Using ctx.collect_events() we can buffer and wait for ALL expected events to arrive. This function will only return data (in the requested order) once all events have arrived.


Up next we'll learn about maintaining state with Context.

Branching Based on the Runtime Conditional Logic
------------------------------------------------

Parallel Execution 
------------------
@step
async def start(self, ctx: Context, ev: StartEvent):
    ctx.send_event(StepTwoEvent(query="Query 1"))
    ctx.send_event(StepTwoEvent(query="Query 2"))
    ctx.send_event(StepTwoEvent(query="Query 3"))

And then handle them in a concurrent step:
@step(num_workers=4)
async def step_two(self, ctx: Context, ev: StepTwoEvent) -> StopEvent:
    # handle each event possibly in parallel (up to 4 at a time)
    return StopEvent(result=ev.query)


Synchronizing with collect_events
If you need to wait for all parallel tasks to complete before continuing, you can use ctx.collect_events:
@step
async def step_three(self, ctx: Context, ev: StepThreeEvent) -> StopEvent | None:
    # wait for 3 StepThreeEvent events
    result = ctx.collect_events(ev, [StepThreeEvent] * 3)
    if result is None:
        return None
    # all 3 have arrived
    return StopEvent(result="Done")


Parallel What I need for my Project - Bank Statement Analyzer 
-------------------------------------------------------------
class ParallelBranchWorkflow(Workflow):
    @step
    async def start(self, ctx: Context, ev: StartEvent):
        ctx.send_event(EventA())
        ctx.send_event(EventB())
        ctx.send_event(EventC())

    @step(num_workers=3)
    async def handle_parallel(self, ctx: Context, ev: EventA | EventB | EventC):
        # process based on event type
        return CompleteEvent(type=type(ev), result=...)

    @step
    async def join(self, ctx: Context, ev: CompleteEvent) -> StopEvent | None:
        res = ctx.collect_events(ev, [CompleteEvent, CompleteEvent, CompleteEvent])
        if res is None:
            return None
        # All parallel branches have completed
        return StopEvent(result="All done")


Branching: Use unions in return types to direct flow to different paths.
Parallelism: Emit multiple events and leverage num_workers to run them concurrently.
Synchronization: Use collect_events to join branches once all required events are done.






Branches and loops
------------------
Loops in workflows
You can create a loop from any step to any other step by defining the appropriate event types and return types.
Branches in workflows
Closely related to looping is branching. As you've already seen, you can conditionally return different events. Let's see a workflow that branches into two different paths:

ChatGPT Responses for Workflow Have to Go Through 



could you please check the Context in the llamaindex workflow 

and how to store the data coming from the start event , search the web and find the solution
and provide example for customized example 


ChatGPT said:
Here’s how Context works in LlamaIndex workflows, especially for capturing data from a StartEvent and storing it for use in later steps. I’ve also included a customizable code example to suit your needs!

What Is the Context Object?
Context is a global state handler for a workflow run—it supports shared storage across all workflow steps and even across multiple runs. It offers coroutine-safe .set() and .get() methods for data manipulation, guarded with locks for thread safety. 
LlamaIndex

Compared to Memory, which typically stores conversation history, Context also maintains the actual workflow state, event queues, and other machinery. 
Reddit

Storing Data from a StartEvent
You can easily grab data from the StartEvent, such as query, and store it into the Context for later retrieval:

python
Copy
Edit
from llama_index.core.workflow import Context, StartEvent, StopEvent, Workflow, step

class MyCustomWorkflow(Workflow):

    @step
    async def start(self, ctx: Context, ev: StartEvent) -> StopEvent:
        # Store data in the global context
        ctx.set("user_query", ev.query)
        return StopEvent(result="Stored query successfully.")

    @step
    async def process(self, ctx: Context, ev: StartEvent) -> StopEvent:
        # Retrieve stored data
        query = ctx.get("user_query")
        # Process the query (just an example)
        processed = f"Processed your query: {query}"
        return StopEvent(result=processed)
Handling Parallel Events & Advanced Flow Control
Use ctx.send_event() to dispatch multiple events (e.g. for parallel tasks), then ctx.collect_events() to gather responses once all are ready. 
Medium
LlamaIndex

Common pattern: send multiple worker events in a start step, have them processed in parallel, and in a final step, wait for all results before proceeding.

Customizable Example: RAG-style Workflow
Here's a more robust scenario—from web search or user input through document retrieval to response synthesis:

python
Copy
Edit
from llama_index.core.workflow import (
    Context, StartEvent, StopEvent, Workflow, step
)

class RAGWorkflow(Workflow):

    @step
    async def start(self, ctx: Context, ev: StartEvent) -> StartEvent:
        # Save the user query and loaded index in context
        ctx.set("query", ev.query)
        ctx.set("index", await load_or_initialize_index())
        return ev  # pass the StartEvent along

    @step
    async def retrieve(self, ctx: Context, ev: StartEvent) -> RetrieverEvent:
        index = ctx.data.get("index")
        if not index:
            print("Index not found!")
            return None
        retriever = index.as_retriever(similarity_top_k=3)
        nodes = retriever.retrieve(ctx.data.get("query"))
        return RetrieverEvent(nodes=nodes)

    @step
    async def synthesize(self, ctx: Context, ev: RetrieverEvent) -> StopEvent:
        query = ctx.data.get("query")
        nodes = ev.nodes
        response = await generate_response(query, nodes)
        return StopEvent(result=response)
This follows real-world RAG pipelines—storing both the search index and the user query, passing the retrieved nodes, and finally synthesizing an answer.

Summary
Feature	Description
ctx.set("key", value)	Store data in shared context for later workflow steps
ctx.get("key")	Retrieve stored data anywhere in the workflow
ctx.send_event(...)	Emit new events for downstream workflow steps
ctx.collect_events(...)	Wait and gather multiple event results for subsequent processing

Let me know what specific structure you’re envisioning (e.g., tool calls, branching logic, custom events), and I can help tailor the workflow to suit your exact requirements!








Sources
You said:
await ctx.store.get("query")
await ctx.store.set("key", val)

but using like this 



ChatGPT said:
Got it — you’re talking about using ctx.store in LlamaIndex workflows instead of just ctx.set / ctx.get.

That’s a newer async key-value store interface inside the workflow context, meant for when you want to persist state between async steps (or even across workflow runs if your store is backed by persistent storage).

How ctx.store Works
ctx.store is an async key–value store (coroutine-based)

await ctx.store.set(key, value) → stores a value

await ctx.store.get(key) → retrieves a value

This is useful if your workflow involves async steps or long-running tasks where you need to avoid race conditions.

Example — Storing StartEvent Data Using ctx.store
python
Copy
Edit
from llama_index.core.workflow import Workflow, StartEvent, StopEvent, step, Context

class MyWorkflow(Workflow):

    @step
    async def start(self, ctx: Context, ev: StartEvent) -> StopEvent:
        # Store the query from StartEvent in async store
        await ctx.store.set("query", ev.query)
        return StopEvent(result="Query stored in ctx.store")

    @step
    async def process(self, ctx: Context, ev: StartEvent) -> StopEvent:
        # Retrieve the stored query
        query = await ctx.store.get("query")
        processed = f"Processed query: {query}"
        return StopEvent(result=processed)
When to Use ctx.store vs ctx.set
Use case	Recommended method
Simple, in-memory sync storage (same step chain)	ctx.set / ctx.get
Async code, long-running steps, possible persistence	await ctx.store.set / await ctx.store.get

Custom Web Search + Storage Example
python
Copy
Edit
from llama_index.core.workflow import Workflow, StartEvent, StopEvent, step, Context

async def search_web(query):
    # Fake async search
    return [f"Result 1 for {query}", f"Result 2 for {query}"]

class SearchWorkflow(Workflow):

    @step
    async def start(self, ctx: Context, ev: StartEvent) -> StartEvent:
        await ctx.store.set("query", ev.query)
        return ev

    @step
    async def search(self, ctx: Context, ev: StartEvent) -> StopEvent:
        query = await ctx.store.get("query")
        results = await search_web(query)
        await ctx.store.set("results", results)
        return StopEvent(result=f"Stored {len(results)} results")

    @step
    async def summarize(self, ctx: Context, ev: StartEvent) -> StopEvent:
        results = await ctx.store.get("results")
        summary = f"Summary: {', '.join(results)}"
        return StopEvent(result=summary)
If you want, I can give you a full runnable example where the workflow starts with a StartEvent, stores the query, does a simulated search, and then retrieves & summarizes results — all using ctx.store.

Do you want me to build that runnable version?

Sure — let’s turn your ParallelBranchWorkflow skeleton into a runnable, self-contained example that actually shows:

How to define custom events (EventA, EventB, EventC, CompleteEvent)

How ctx.send_event() dispatches them in parallel

How ctx.collect_events() waits for all branches to complete before continuing

Full Example

from llama_index.core.workflow import Workflow, Context, StartEvent, StopEvent, step, Event

# --- Custom event definitions ---
class EventA(Event):
    pass

class EventB(Event):
    pass

class EventC(Event):
    pass

class CompleteEvent(Event):
    def __init__(self, type_name: str, result: str):
        self.type_name = type_name
        self.result = result

# --- Workflow implementation ---
class ParallelBranchWorkflow(Workflow):

    @step
    async def start(self, ctx: Context, ev: StartEvent):
        # Send 3 events in parallel
        ctx.send_event(EventA())
        ctx.send_event(EventB())
        ctx.send_event(EventC())

    @step(num_workers=3)
    async def handle_parallel(self, ctx: Context, ev: EventA | EventB | EventC):
        # Simulate processing for each event type
        if isinstance(ev, EventA):
            result = "Processed branch A"
        elif isinstance(ev, EventB):
            result = "Processed branch B"
        elif isinstance(ev, EventC):
            result = "Processed branch C"
        else:
            result = "Unknown event"

        return CompleteEvent(type_name=type(ev).__name__, result=result)

    @step
    async def join(self, ctx: Context, ev: CompleteEvent) -> StopEvent | None:
        # Wait until we have all 3 CompleteEvents
        res = ctx.collect_events(ev, [CompleteEvent, CompleteEvent, CompleteEvent])
        if res is None:
            return None  # Still waiting for other branches

        # Combine all branch results
        combined = [f"{e.type_name}: {e.result}" for e in res]
        return StopEvent(result=" | ".join(combined))

# --- Example runner ---
if __name__ == "__main__":
    from llama_index.core.workflow import run_workflow

    result = run_workflow(
        ParallelBranchWorkflow(),
        StartEvent(query="Run parallel workflow")
    )
    print("Final result:", result.result)
How It Works
start step
Sends EventA, EventB, and EventC into the workflow engine without waiting for them to finish.

handle_parallel step
Runs up to 3 workers in parallel (because of num_workers=3). Each worker gets one event, processes it, and returns a CompleteEvent.

join step
Uses ctx.collect_events() to accumulate CompleteEvents until all three branches have reported back.
When all are ready, it combines results and stops the workflow with a StopEvent.

If you want, I can extend this so that ctx.store is also used to persist intermediate results from each branch before joining. That way, even if the workflow restarts mid-run, results aren’t lost.

Do you want me to add that persistence layer?




You said:
in my case, 
i have start event and passing the data from workflow.run(data)
and i have creditclassify and debitclassify , both can run in parallel, and then return the output to start the Surplus_assessment and debitclassify return the output to start the DBT_assessment and Bheaviour_assessement 


ChatGPT said:
Okay — so your workflow looks something like this:

StartEvent (input data from workflow.run(data))

creditclassify & debitclassify run in parallel

After both finish → start Surplus_assessment

debitclassify’s result also triggers DBT_assessment and Behaviour_assessment in parallel

That’s basically a fan-out → fan-in → fan-out pattern.
Here’s a clear way to model it in LlamaIndex’s workflow system.

Example Workflow
python
Copy

from llama_index.core.workflow import Workflow, Context, StartEvent, StopEvent, step, Event

# ----- Custom Events -----

    def __init__(self, result):
        self.result = result

class DebitResultEvent(Event):
    def __init__(self, result):
        self.result = result

        self.debit_result = debit_result

class DBTAssessmentEvent(Event):
    def __init__(self, debit_result):
        self.debit_result = debit_result

class BehaviourAssessmentEvent(Event):
    def __init__(self, debit_result):
        self.debit_result = debit_result


# ----- Workflow -----
class FinanceWorkflow(Workflow):

    @step
    async def start(self, ctx: Context, ev: StartEvent):
        # Fan-out to credit & debit classification in parallel
        ctx.send_event(CreditClassifyEvent(ev.query))
        ctx.send_event(DebitClassifyEvent(ev.query))

    @step
    async def credit_classify(self, ctx: Context, ev: CreditClassifyEvent) -> CreditResultEvent:
        # Your credit classification logic here
        credit_result = f"Credit classified for {ev.data}"
        return CreditResultEvent(credit_result)

    @step
    async def debit_classify(self, ctx: Context, ev: DebitClassifyEvent) -> DebitResultEvent:
        # Your debit classification logic here
        debit_result = f"Debit classified for {ev.data}"
        return DebitResultEvent(debit_result)

    @step
    async def join_for_surplus(self, ctx: Context, ev: CreditResultEvent | DebitResultEvent):
        # Wait for both credit & debit classification to finish
        results = ctx.collect_events(ev, [CreditResultEvent, DebitResultEvent])
        if results is None:
            return None
        credit_event, debit_event = results
        ctx.send_event(SurplusAssessmentEvent(credit_event.result, debit_event.result))

    @step
    async def surplus_assessment(self, ctx: Context, ev: SurplusAssessmentEvent) -> StopEvent:
        # Logic for surplus assessment
        surplus = f"Surplus assessment using {ev.credit_result} and {ev.debit_result}"
        return StopEvent(result=surplus)

    @step
    async def trigger_from_debit(self, ctx: Context, ev: DebitResultEvent):
        # Fan-out from debit classification
        ctx.send_event(DBTAssessmentEvent(ev.result))
        ctx.send_event(BehaviourAssessmentEvent(ev.result))

    @step
    async def dbt_assessment(self, ctx: Context, ev: DBTAssessmentEvent):
        dbt_result = f"DBT assessment from {ev.debit_result}"
        print(dbt_result)

    @step
    async def behaviour_assessment(self, ctx: Context, ev: BehaviourAssessmentEvent):
        behaviour_result = f"Behaviour assessment from {ev.debit_result}"
        print(behaviour_result)
How the Flow Works
start
Sends both CreditClassifyEvent and DebitClassifyEvent → they run in parallel.

credit_classify & debit_classify
Produce CreditResultEvent and DebitResultEvent.

join_for_surplus
Uses ctx.collect_events() to wait for both classification results → triggers SurplusAssessmentEvent.

trigger_from_debit
Runs in parallel with join_for_surplus, because it’s triggered directly from DebitResultEvent, and sends DBTAssessmentEvent + BehaviourAssessmentEvent.

dbt_assessment & behaviour_assessment
Run independently from the debit classification output.

If you want, I can extend this to also use ctx.store so that all intermediate outputs (credit, debit, surplus, DBT, behaviour) are stored for later retrieval — useful if you want a single StopEvent at the very end.

Do you want me to add that persistent storage layer so your workflow has one final combined output?




You said:
what if i store the startevent data in context, then i can reuse in credit_classify , then how it will be, having CreditClassifyEvent is waste right


ChatGPT said:
Exactly — if your StartEvent data is stored in ctx.store or ctx.set at the beginning, then you don’t need to wrap it inside a CreditClassifyEvent or DebitClassifyEvent just to pass it along.

Those event classes are really only useful if:

You need to attach different kinds of payloads for different branches

Or you need to differentiate workflow routing by event type

If both credit_classify and debit_classify can just pull the same input data from context, you can simplify the design.

Refactored Workflow (No CreditClassifyEvent)

        await ctx.store.set("input_data", ev.query)

        # Trigger parallel classification steps
        ctx.send_event("credit_classify")  # no payload needed
        ctx.send_event("debit_classify")

    @step
    async def behaviour_assessment(self, ctx: Context, ev: BehaviourAssessmentEvent):
        print(f"Behaviour assessment from {ev.debit_result}")
Why This Is Cleaner
No redundant payload events — everything pulls the base input from ctx.store

Event classes are only for results or branch-specific outputs

You keep routing flexibility:

"credit_classify" step is triggered directly by name

"debit_classify" triggers two other assessments via DebitResultEvent

If you want, I can make this fully end-to-end runnable so that it prints all intermediate and final results, showing exactly how ctx.store lets every branch reuse StartEvent’s data without extra event classes.

Do you want me to make that runnable example?

        result = f"Debit classified for {data}"
        return DebitResultEvent(result)

so these two steps will execute parallely , without mentioning number of workers 


ChatGPT said:
Yes — in LlamaIndex workflows, if you send two different events to two different steps, those steps will execute in parallel even if you don’t set num_workers.

Here’s why:

num_workers only controls parallelism for multiple events handled by the same step.

In your case, credit_classify and debit_classify are different steps, so they each get their own async task in the workflow engine.

Once you do:

python
Copy
Edit
ctx.send_event("credit_classify")
ctx.send_event("debit_classify")
… the workflow scheduler will start both steps independently, and they’ll run concurrently by default.

Visualizing Your Case
vbnet
Copy
Edit
StartEvent
   ├── ctx.send_event("credit_classify")  → Step credit_classify
   └── ctx.send_event("debit_classify")   → Step debit_classify
These two fan out and run in parallel.

You’d only need num_workers if you had something like:

python
Copy
Edit
@step(num_workers=3)
async def classify_transactions(self, ctx, ev: TransactionEvent):
    ...
… where you want the same step to process multiple events at the same time.

If you want, I can show you exactly how to send those two steps in parallel from start() and then wait for both results with ctx.collect_events() before moving on to Surplus_assessment. That would be the cleanest chain for your case.

Do you want me to put that together?



workflows.errors.WorkflowValidationError: Return types of workflows step functions must be annotated with their type.


ChatGPT said:
Ah — that error happens because in LlamaIndex workflows every @step function must have an explicit return type annotation that matches what it actually returns.

Even if your step doesn’t return anything (None) or you’re just sending events, you still have to annotate it.

Why You’re Getting It
In your snippet:

python
Copy
Edit
@step(name="credit_classify")
async def credit_classify(self, ctx: Context, ev: Event) -> CreditResultEvent:
    data = await ctx.store.get("input_data")
    result = f"Credit classified for {data}"
    return CreditResultEvent(result)

@step(name="debit_classify")
async def debit_classify(self, ctx: Context, ev: Event) -> DebitResultEvent:
    data = await ctx.store.get("input_data")
    result = f"Debit classified for {data}"
    return DebitResultEvent(result)
These are fine, because you’re returning CreditResultEvent and DebitResultEvent and have the type hints.

The problem is probably in another step (like start) where you didn’t annotate the return type:

python
Copy
Edit
@step
async def start(self, ctx: Context, ev: StartEvent):
    await ctx.store.set("input_data", ev.query)
    ctx.send_event("credit_classify")
    ctx.send_event("debit_classify")
That has no return type annotation, so the workflow validator complains.

Fix
If a step returns nothing, you must annotate -> None:

python
Copy
Edit
@step
async def start(self, ctx: Context, ev: StartEvent) -> None:
    await ctx.store.set("input_data", ev.query)
    ctx.send_event("credit_classify")
    ctx.send_event("debit_classify")
If a step stops the workflow:

python
Copy
Edit
@step
async def surplus_assessment(self, ctx: Context, ev: SurplusAssessmentEvent) -> StopEvent:
    ...
    return StopEvent(result="Surplus done")
✅ Rule of thumb:
Every step in a LlamaIndex workflow must have a return type hint that’s either:

-> None (no return, only sends events)

-> StopEvent (ends workflow)

-> EventSubclass (emits that event)

-> Union[EventSubclass, None] (conditionally emits)

If you want, I can rewrite your whole workflow with all the correct type hints so it passes validation and still runs credit and debit classification in parallel. Would you like me to do that?
