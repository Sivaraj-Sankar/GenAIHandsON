A2A - AI agents to communicate, collaborate, and coordinate with each other across different platforms, frameworks, or organizations
    - A2A builds on existing web & messaging standards like HTTP, JSON-RPC, Server-Sent Events (SSE),

Component
Agent Card   - A JSON metadata descriptor agents publish. It describes the agent’s capabilities, supported modalities, endpoint URLs, authentication requirements, etc.
Client Agent / Remote Agent   - A “client” agent can initiate tasks; a “remote” agent receives and acts on tasks.
Task / Task Lifecycle         - Tasks are units of work with well-defined states (e.g. pending, in progress, completed, failed). Agents exchange messages about task progress.
Message / Parts               - Messages exchanged between agents often contain “parts” (text, structured JSON, file attachments, etc.). Agents negotiate the best modality (text, JSON, file, UI elements) via messages.
Discovery / Capability Discovery - Before interacting, an agent can discover what remote agents exist and what they can do (via Agent Cards) so tasks can be dispatched appropriately.
Security / Authentication / Authorization - The protocol is designed “secure by default” — requiring identity, authentication, authorization, encryption, etc.
Long-Running Tasks & Streaming Updates - Agents should support operations that take long time — providing intermediate status, partial results, or streaming updates.

Use A2A in a multi-agent system
-------------------------------
1. Define & Publish Agent Card(s)
* For each agent you build (remote or client), create an Agent Card in JSON. This should include:
  Agent name and description
  Endpoint(s) (e.g. HTTP URL)
  Supported modalities / message content types (text, JSON, files)
  Authentication / security requirements
  Versioning, metadata, etc.
Make this Agent Card retrievable (e.g. host at a well-known URL). Agents that want to interact can fetch it to know how to talk to you.
2. Discovery & Matching
A client agent (or an orchestration layer) should look up potential remote agents via their Agent Cards.
Based on the capabilities advertised, decide which agent(s) to send tasks to.
3. Establish Secure Communication
Use the authentication & authorization mechanisms defined (e.g. API keys, OAuth, mutual TLS, JWTs) for trust.
Ensure encryption (TLS / HTTPS) for message transport.
Implement any access control (which agent can do what).

4.Initiate a Task / Send a Message
* The client agent sends a task request to the remote agent’s endpoint per the A2A spec.
* Include a task ID, initial message parts, context, etc
* The remote agent acknowledges, transitions the task into “in progress,” “pending,” etc.

5.Collaboration & Messaging
Agents exchange messages with parts (text, JSON, files) as work proceeds.
If a remote agent needs to delegate a subtask further, it could itself act as a “client” and talk to another agent.
Streaming updates (via SSE or push notifications) let client and remote agents stay in sync.

6.Handle Completion / Failure / Cancellation
Once the task is done, remote agent responds with result parts/artifacts.
If failure or cancellation occurs, send error messages, partial artifacts, or rollback instructions.
Agents update statuses, logs, and optionally notify users.

7.Logging, Audit & Observability
For real-world systems, maintain logs, audit trails, metrics, error tracking, observability—key for debugging, reliability, compliance.
Monitor agent interactions, latencies, error rates.


You have multiple autonomous agents that need to collaborate (not just a single agent calling APIs).
Those agents are built in different frameworks, possibly by different organizations, and you want interoperability.
Tasks are complex, multi-step, involving delegation, back-and-forth, or long-running processes.
You care about security, governance, modularity, and want to avoid point-to-point, ad-hoc integrations.
You want each agent’s internal implementation, memory, or tools to remain opaque (hidden) — only exposing the interface via A2A.

It’s less useful if your system is simple (one agent, direct API calls) or when all logic lives in a monolithic system without need for cross-agent communication.


Limitations
Inter-agent micropayments, decentralized identity, or ledger-based discoverability are being explored in research to extend A2A. For example, a paper proposes integrating distributed ledger tech to publish AgentCards and support micropayments
https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19550?utm_source=chatgpt.com
Ensuring security, trust, and preventing malicious agents is a non-trivial aspect in open ecosystems.
While A2A handles agent-to-agent collaboration, agents still need to use MCP (or similar) to access tools, APIs, data, etc.

LangGraph Agent - Low Level Framework 
Task lifecycle semantics: A2A defines task states, messaging conventions (e.g. task/send, task/subscribe, task/get, etc.).
Streaming, push notifications, etc. Agents can send status messages, intermediate updates, partial results, etc.


Key
You want standardized discovery / capability matching
So one agent can query “which agents can do X?” without hardcoding endpoints.
You need robust task protocols
With error states, retries, streaming updates, cancellations, long-running tasks.
You need secure agent communication boundaries

Complexity 
Added complexity: You’ll have to implement or adopt A2A compliance (Agent Cards, endpoints, task APIs, messaging, error handling).
Library / ecosystem maturity: A2A is relatively new; supporting libraries, tooling, documentation, community support may be evolving.
Overhead: Protocol overhead (serialization, network, authentication) may introduce latency.
Versioning & compatibility: You’ll need to coordinate versions of A2A spec, LangGraph integration, and agents built in different frameworks.
Debugging & observability: You’ll want tooling to trace cross-agent calls, logs, failures, boundary transitions.

Eg in multi-tenant environments, or where agents cross trust domains.
