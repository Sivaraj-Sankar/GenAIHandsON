Choosing Tech Stack 
Choosing Tools that support by Tech Stack

Monolithic[Spring Boot, .NET Core, Rails] = All Functionality in a single deployable unit. --> Legacy Systems, simplicity, fast iteration, no inter-process communication
                                                            --> Hard to Scale, single point of failure, long deployment cycles. 

Layered (N-tier)[JEE, ASP.NET MVC, Spring MVC]  = Functional Layers (UI -> Service -> DAO -> DB). --> | classic Enterprise apps, clear separation of concerns, easy to understand, modular-testing
                                                                                                      | Over-Engineering, tight coupling between layers if not disciplined. 


Client-Server/Thin-Client[REST, gRPC, GraphQL]    Dedicated Server serve data --> clients consume via API or UI, --> webapps, desktop clients, mobile backends, | centralised control, straightforward security model
                                                                                             --> Network Latency, single server bottleneck

Microkernel (Plug-in) [OSGi, Eclipse RCP, Netty Extensions]    --> Core Engine + Pluggable modules, |IDEs, OS Kernels, modular business apps, 
                                                               --> Extendable without recompilation, isolation. | Versioning of plugins, risk of core-module mismatch. 
                                                               --> 

Microservices[Docker + Kubernetes, Istio, Spring Cloud]      --> Each service owns a bounded context, services communicate over network usually(HTTP/REST or message bus)
                   --> Large Evolving systems, CI/CD Pipelines, polyglot teams, Independent deployment, fault isolation. language flexibility, Distributed transaction complexity, network overhead, ops burden

Service‚ÄëOriented Architecture (SOA)[Apache CXF, WSO2, MuleSoft] - Reusable services exposed via contracts (WSDL, REST).Enterprise integration, on‚Äëprem legacy systems, Reusability, governance.
                                    -> Heavyweight protocols, slow service contracts, coupling through a shared service bus.

**Event‚ÄëDriven Architecture (EDA)[Kafka, RabbitMQ, Azure Event Grid] --> Decoupled components react to events on a publish/subscribe channel.
                                      Real‚Äëtime dashboards, IoT backends, loosely coupled workflows.
                                      High scalability, natural async patterns, easy to add new consumers
                                      Event ordering guarantees,
                                      event storming‚Äù overhead, debugging difficulty.

**Message‚ÄëDriven / Message‚ÄëQueue**[ActiveMQ, Amazon SQS, Kafka] --> Tasks are serialized into messages that are queued and processed asynchronously.
                                   --> Background jobs, batch pipelines, order processing. | Asynchronous flow, decoupling of producer/consumer.
                                   --> Potential message loss if not idempotent, latency.


Saga / Orchestration[Temporal, Zeebe, Netflix Conductor]                 ----> Long‚Äërunning distributed transactions broken into compensating actions.
                                           Order‚Äëfulfillment, booking systems, micro‚Äëservice workflows.
                                           Consistency without distributed ACID.
                                           Complex orchestration logic, need for persistence.


Hexagonal (Ports & Adapters) / Clean / Onion[Spring Hexagonal, Micronaut, ASP.NET Clean Architecture]  --> Outer adapters plug into inner domain; business logic is isolated from frameworks.
                                              --> Domain‚Äëheavy apps, test‚Äëfirst development, maintainability.
                                              --> Clear separation, testable domain, easier migration.
                                              --> Requires discipline to keep inner layers pure

Event‚ÄëSourced [Axon, EventStore, Kafka]    ----> State is derived from an immutable stream of events
                  ----> current state is the result of replaying the stream.
                  ----> Auditable systems, finance, analytics pipelines
                  ----> Full audit trail, easy replay, time‚Äëtravel debugging.
                  ----> Event schema evolution, large storage footprint, complexity of read‚Äëmodels.

Event Sourcing Architecture 
used in software systems where state is not stored directly, but instead derived from a sequence of immutable events.
Instead of storing the current state of an object, you store a log of all the events that have happened to that object.
The current state is then reconstructed by replaying those events.



Core Components

Event

A fact that something happened in the system (e.g., UserRegistered, ProductAddedToCart, OrderShipped).

Events are immutable and timestamped.
Event Store
----------
A specialized database or log where events are saved in order.
Unlike a typical database, this is append-only.
Aggregate (or Entity)
--------------------
A business object whose state is reconstructed by replaying the sequence of events related to it.
Does not store its state persistently‚Äîstate is rebuilt on demand.
Command
-------
A request to perform an action (e.g., RegisterUser, AddItemToCart).
Commands lead to state changes which are captured as new events.
Event Handler / Projector / Read Model
--------------------------------------
Components that listen to events and update read-optimized views or external systems.
Helps in CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation), where read and write models are separate.

Banking systems: Every transaction is an event
E-commerce: Order lifecycle tracked via events
Git: Commits are events; state is built from history

Financial systems
Auditable systems
Collaborative apps
Domain-driven systems

Poor Use case for Event Sourcing 
System Requires Strong ACID 


Advantages:
Auditing / Traceability: Full history of all changes
Debugging & Replay: You can "replay" events to recreate bugs or recover state
Scalability: Works well with CQRS and microservices
Flexibility: You can build different views of the data from the same event log

‚ùå Challenges:
Complexity: Harder to reason about than CRUD
Event versioning: Updating old events when your data model changes
Eventual consistency: Read models may not be up-to-date instantly
Storage: Event logs can grow large


Flow Example

Command is sent: CreateOrder
Command handler validates and creates a new event: OrderCreated
Event is saved to the event store
Aggregate replays events to reconstruct current state
Event is dispatched to event handlers, which update read models or trigger side effects (like sending an email)

intuitive at the beginning because it's very different from traditional database-driven design.
---------------
Start With a Real-World Analogy: Banking Ledger
---------------------
Imagine you're a bank.
You never just store the current balance of a bank account in real life.
Instead, you store a list of all transactions (deposits and withdrawals), and the current balance is calculated by adding them up.

That‚Äôs event sourcing.
Each transaction is an event.

You're not saving the balance directly (the state). You're saving every event that led to it, so you can always:

Go back in time and check what happened
Recalculate balances if needed
Audit for fraud or errors

Now, Intuitively Understand the Flow
Let's walk through this again, but now with WHY behind each step:


Event 
Event Store 
Aggregate (or Entity) 
Command 
Event Handler/Projector/Read Model 

1. Command is sent: CreateOrder
In traditional systems, this might directly write to the database.
But in event sourcing, we don't change state immediately.
2.Command handler validates and creates a new event: OrderCreated
If valid, we record the fact: "An order WAS created."
This is now an event ‚Äì a historical fact.
3.Event is saved to the event store
üì¶ We store this immutable fact ‚Äî forever.
Now we have a permanent record.
We‚Äôre building a timeline of what happened ‚Äî just like a transaction log.
4.Aggregate replays events to reconstruct current state
To know the current state of an order, we replay its event history.

E.g., if an order has these events:
OrderCreated
ItemAdded
OrderConfirmed
We replay them to know its state: items in cart, status = confirmed.
5.Event is dispatched to event handlers, which update read models or trigger side effects
Now we notify other parts of the system: "Hey, something happened."
Maybe we update a read model (e.g., list of user orders).
Maybe we send an email confirmation.
Maybe we update analytics.

1. Full History (Auditability) - You can rebuild any past state [Invaluable for financial, legal, or regulated systems.]
2. Debugging & Replay [You can replay the whole system and see where it broke.]
Reproduce bugs exactly as they happened.
Recalculate state from scratch.
3. Scalable Read Models (CQRS)
Separate read models from write logic:
Reads are fast, denormalized, and can be optimized per use case.
Writes are clean, consistent, and business-driven.

4.Flexible Side Effects
When an event happens, you can:
Send emails
Update search indexes
Notify other systems
All decoupled, without changing core logic.

5.Business Logic Mirrors the Real World
Users don't think in terms of "records"; they think in actions:
"I placed an order"
"I changed my address"
"I canceled the subscription"

Event sourcing mirrors this mental model.
Because it‚Äôs more complex to implement and maintain:
Requires event versioning when your data model evolves.
Harder to query without read models.
Requires thinking in events, which is not natural for many developers.

Use Event Sourcing if:
You need an audit trail or history
You want to replay or analyze past events
You have complex business workflows
You're building a distributed or microservices system
You want CQRS or event-driven architectures
Avoid it if your app is just simple CRUD (like a to-do list or blog).


------
Command‚ÄëQuery Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) [Axon, NServiceBus, Spring Data] - Separate read and write models; often combined with event sourcing.
                                                - Systems with heavy read‚Äëload or complex queries (e.g., analytics).
                                                - Optimised queries, scaling reads independently.
                                                - Duplication of data, consistency challenges.

Reactive / Event‚ÄëLoop[Project Reactor, RxJava, Akka Streams, Vert.x] --> Non‚Äëblocking, back‚Äëpressure aware streams;
                      --> often built on the Reactive Streams spec.
                      --> High‚Äëthroughput real‚Äëtime services, IoT, streaming pipelines.
                      --> Handles many concurrent connections, better resource utilisation.
                      --> Steep learning curve, debugging async flows can be hard.

Serverless / FaaS [AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions]---> Stateless functions run in response to events.
                       billing per invocation.
                       Event‚Äëdriven micro‚Äëtasks, short‚Äëlived compute.
                       variable load.
                       No server management, auto‚Äëscaling, cost‚Äëefficient for sporadic load.
                       Cold‚Äëstart latency, vendor lock‚Äëin, statefulness requires external stores.

Event‚ÄëDriven (within a microservice) [Kafka, NATS, Pulsar] --> Services publish domain events;
                                         other services react (pub/sub) to them
                                         Highly decoupled integrations, real‚Äëtime dashboards, analytics
                                         Loose coupling, easy to add new consumers
                                         Event flooding, versioning of event schemas, debugging

Multi‚Äëtenant / SaaS [Salesforce, Stripe, multi‚Äëtenant DB schemas]  --> Shared infrastructure but tenant‚Äëisolated data, SaaS platforms, shared APIs.
                      --> Cost sharing, quick onboarding of new tenants.
                      --> Security boundaries, resource contention, tenant‚Äëspecific customisation.


Component‚ÄëBased - Self‚Äëcontained components that can be reused or swapped (often used for UI).
                - Front‚Äëend libraries, UI frameworks. | Reusability, independent release cycles.
                - Inconsistent API contracts, integration friction.
                - React Components, Vue, Web Components

‚Ä¢ *Need fast time‚Äëto‚Äëmarket and a single team? Monolith or layered.  
>  ‚Ä¢ *Have a rapidly evolving, large code‚Äëbase? Microservices or SOA.  
>  ‚Ä¢ *Want event‚Äëdriven real‚Äëtime flow? EDA + reactive patterns.  
>  ‚Ä¢ *Need on‚Äëprem, strongly governed services? SOA or micro‚Äëkernel.*

Push/Pull 
--------- 
API's
Push: A webhook sends data to your app when something happens (e.g., Stripe sends payment info when a payment is made).
Pull: Your app periodically calls (polls) an API to ask if something changed

Data Synchronization
Push: A server sends real-time updates to clients (e.g., chat messages in WhatsApp).
Pull: A client regularly checks the server for new messages.

Build Systems / CI/CD
Push-based triggers: When code is pushed, the pipeline runs automatically.
Pull-based triggers: The CI system polls the repo for changes at intervals.

Messaging Systems
Push: A message broker (like Kafka) pushes data to subscribers.
Pull: Consumers pull messages from the queue when they're ready.

Push & Pull in Computing 
processor architecture, memory management, data pipelines, and parallel computing
Streaming, event-driven systems, GPUs (some cases) - Push 
Polling, lazy evaluation, demand-driven systems - Pull

Push-based dataflow: Data is pushed through the pipeline as it becomes available.
E.g., Reactive programming (RxJS, Reactive Streams)

Dataflow / Stream Processing
Pull-based dataflow: Downstream components pull data when ready.
E.g., Iterators or generators in Python/JavaScript.

Push = Event streams
Pull = Iterators / lazy evaluation

Caches & Memory Hierarchies
Push: A system writes (pushes) data proactively to cache or memory (e.g., write-through cache).
Pull: A component requests (pulls) data when it's not available locally (e.g., cache miss triggers memory fetch).



-----------------------
Domain Driven Design  (DDD) approach in your architecture 

1.DDD is not a ‚Äúnew architecture‚Äù per se‚Äî
2.it is a set of principles and patterns that help you model [complex business domains] in code. 
3.The benefits translate into multiple layers of the architecture

Model the true business problem                                                                                            Patterns
------------------------------
Domain model captures real concepts (aggregates, entities, value objects). [Domain‚Äëcentric layers (hexagonal, clean).] -    Domain‚Äëevent, repository, service objects

Make the domain testable
-----------------------
Business logic lives in pure, side‚Äëeffect‚Äëfree code. [Domain‚Äëonly layer; outer frameworks are adapters] --->                TDD, unit tests for domain

Encourage clear boundaries
-------------------------
Bounded contexts isolate different areas of the domain [Multiple bounded contexts as separate services or modules.]       CQRS, EDA for inter‚Äëbounded‚Äëcontext communication.

Provide an audit trail
----------------------
State is derived from events, not overwritten   [Event‚Äësourced systems]                                                   [Event‚Äësource, read‚Äëmodel projection]


Scale reads and writes independently
------------------------------------
Separate read/write concerns.                  [CQRS or read‚Äëmodel services]                                              Separate database schemas, query optimization

Enable real‚Äëtime reaction
-------------------------
Publish events whenever something happens      EDA, reactive streams                                                       Kafka, message brokers, asynchronous handlers. |


Facilitate continuous delivery
------------------------------  
Domain logic is decoupled from infrastructure        [Clean/hexagonal architecture]                                     Inversion of control, DI containers.


When should you adopt DDD
1. **High domain complexity** ‚Äì if your business logic is non‚Äëtrivial, multiple entities, and heavy business rules.
2. **Long‚Äëterm maintainability** ‚Äì you expect the system to evolve over time and want to isolate change.
3. **Multiple developers/teams** ‚Äì you need clear boundaries and governance so teams can work independently.
4. **Need for deep insight and auditability** ‚Äì event sourcing gives you a natural audit trail.

When can you skip it?**
- **Simple CRUD apps** or where the domain logic is trivial ‚Äì a CRUD‚Äëonly architecture (e.g., ‚ÄúCRUD‚Äëonly microservices‚Äù or ‚Äúserverless CRUD‚Äù) may be more efficient.
- **Very small teams** where learning DDD‚Äôs patterns adds overhead faster than it brings benefits.
- **Performance‚Äëcritical, stateful services** where pure DDD‚Äôs separation might add latency (unless combined with caching or read‚Äëmodels).

**Architectural options for ‚ÄúDomain-Driven‚Äù services**
1.Domain‚ÄëDriven + Microservices

| **Option** | **Description** | **Typical Stack** | **Pros** | **Cons** |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|----------|----------|
| **DDD + EDA** | Each microservice owns its domain model and publishes events. Other services react. | Spring Boot (Hexagonal) + Kafka, Akka | Loose coupling, clear event flow, scalability. | Event storming complexity, need for event schema governance. |
| **DDD + CQRS** | Separate command and query services per bounded context. | Axon framework, Spring Data, EventStore | Optimised reads, easy scaling. | Complexity of maintaining two models; consistency. |
| **DDD + Event Sourcing** | Persist state as events; read‚Äëmodels projected separately. | Axon, EventStore, Kafka | Audit trail, ability to replay. | Event schema evolution; larger storage cost. |
| **DDD + Clean Architecture** | Keep domain pure; infrastructure (Spring MVC, JPA) plugs in as adapters. | Spring Hexagonal, Micronaut | Testable domain, easier migrations. | Requires discipline, can increase boilerplate. |
| **DDD + Serverless** | Domain logic runs in functions; events trigger actions. | AWS Lambda + Step Functions + DynamoDB | Pay‚Äëper‚Äëuse, easy scaling for event bursts. | Cold starts, limited compute time, vendor lock‚Äëin. |

3.2  Choosing the right mix

| **Consideration** | **Choose** | **Why** |
|-------------------|------------|---------|
| **Synchronous business flows** | DDD + Clean / Hexagonal + Spring MVC | Keeps domain pure, simple to debug. |
| **Asynchronous or real‚Äëtime flows** | DDD + EDA (Kafka) + reactive streams | Handles high concurrency, decoupled. |
| **High read‚Äëwrite imbalance** | CQRS + event sourcing | Reads are fast and can scale. |
| **Short, stateless compute tasks** | Serverless + DDD + event‚Äëdriven | Minimal infrastructure, auto‚Äëscale. |

4.The Role of the ‚ÄúBusiness Service‚Äù and its Impact on the Architecture
What is a Business Service?
A *business service* is a component that encapsulates domain logic that cannot be naturally expressed in an entity or value object. Think of it as a *Domain Service* in DDD. In a microservice, it is typically a **stateless class** that orchestrates domain objects or coordinates multiple bounded contexts.


Business‚ÄëService‚ÄëCentric Architecture

| **Architecture** | **Components** | **How It Looks** | **When It Helps** |
|------------------|---------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Microservice (CRUD‚Äëonly)** | REST API + CRUD service + repository | Simple CRUD, no domain model. | Small or simple domain. |
| **Microservice (DDD)** | Domain model + repository + domain service | Business rules in domain. | Complex domain, long‚Äëterm evolution. |
| **Microservice (Business‚ÄëService‚Äëonly)** | A thin service layer that uses domain objects or external services but no complex DDD concepts. | Spring Service + Spring Data | Quick to implement, still separates concerns. | Harder to evolve complex domain logic. |
| **Monolithic Service (DDD)** | All domain logic in one process, possibly with bounded contexts inside. | Spring Boot + Hexagonal | Simpler deployment. | Single point of failure, scaling may be harder. |
| **Service‚ÄëOriented (SOA)** | Business services that expose business operations as SOAP or REST endpoints. | Spring WS or Spring MVC | Legacy system integration. | Heavier protocol, more overhead. |

Impact on the architecture

| **Layer** | **DDD‚Äëcentric service** | **Non‚ÄëDDD** | **Effect** |
|-----------|------------------------|-------------|------------|
| **Presentation** | Thin adapter (e.g., REST controller). | Complex domain logic mixed in. | Easier to change UI/transport. |
| **Application** | Orchestrates domain services, uses DI. | Domain logic often in controllers. | Better separation, easier unit tests. |
| **Domain** | Pure business logic, immutable entities, value objects. | Often combined with persistence logic. | Evolves independently of tech. |
| **Infrastructure** | Adapters for persistence, messaging, etc. | Mixed with business logic. | Higher coupling, harder to swap tech. |

4. **Designing a microservice using the ‚ÄúDomain‚ÄëDriven‚Äù concept**

Let‚Äôs walk through a **step‚Äëby‚Äëstep** approach to building a domain‚Äëdriven microservice. We‚Äôll use **Java + Spring Boot** with **Hexagonal/clean architecture** as the skeleton and **Kafka** for event‚Äëdriving.  
Feel free to swap languages or frameworks if you‚Äôre in .NET, Go, Node, or others; the concepts remain.

### 4.1  Identify the Bounded Context

- **Domain**: *Order Processing* (customer orders, payments, shipping).
- **Entities**: `Order`, `LineItem`, `Address`, `Payment`.
- **Value Objects**: `Money`, `OrderStatus`.
- **Aggregates**: `Order` (root) encapsulates `LineItem` and `Payment`.


MVC = MTV (Model-Template-View) --> In a blog site, the Model would be blog posts stored in a database, the View would be the HTML page displaying posts, and the Controller would handle user actions like creating a new post.
In Django:
MVC Term	Django Term
Model	Model
View	Template
Controller	View
Model:
Manages data, business logic, and rules.
Talks to the database or other data sources.
Not concerned with how data is displayed.
View:
The UI of the application.
Presents data to the user (usually from the model).
Doesn‚Äôt contain logic about how data is fetched.
Controller:
Handles input from the user (e.g., mouse clicks, form submissions).
Updates the model and decides which view to display.
Acts as a bridge between Model and View.
MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) --> Used in: WPF (Windows), Android (Jetpack), iOS (SwiftUI), and web frameworks like KnockoutJS.
    Components:
       Model: Same as in MVC.
       View: UI, binds to ViewModel.
       ViewModel: Holds UI logic, binds View to Model using data-binding.
       Difference: MVVM emphasizes data binding between View and ViewModel, reducing boilerplate code.
MVP (Model-View-Presenter) --> Used in: Android, .NET, some web apps.
     Components:
      Model: Business/data logic.
      View: UI (dumb, passive).
      Presenter: Handles all presentation logic, talks to Model and View.
      Difference: The Presenter controls the flow and updates the View explicitly (no data binding).


PAC (Presentation-Abstraction-Control)
Similar to MVC, but allows more modular component design.
Each component has:
Presentation: UI
Abstraction: Data and logic
Control: Coordination between the two
Used in more complex or distributed UI systems (e.g., multimedia apps).

Flux / Redux (used in React)
Used in: React (web and native), Vue, etc.
Unidirectional data flow.
Components:
Store: Holds application state.
Actions: Events describing what happened.
Reducers: Pure functions that update the state.
View: React components that render UI.
Difference: Data only flows one way, which simplifies state management.


Clean Architecture (by Uncle Bob)
Emphasizes separation of concerns via layers:
Entities: Business rules.
Use Cases / Interactors: Application-specific logic.
Interface Adapters: Presenters, Controllers.
Frameworks & Drivers: UI, DB, external systems.
Common in backend APIs and scalable systems.


Pattern	Focus	Data Flow	Typical Use
MVC	UI + Logic Separation	Two-way	Web apps
MVP	Presenter handles logic	Two-way	Android, .NET
MVVM	Data binding	Two-way	Mobile, UI-heavy apps
Flux/Redux	Centralized state, one-way	One-way	React, frontend
Clean Architecture	Layered design	Controlled	Backend, scalable systems



1. Model (M) ‚Äì The Data Layer - Think of the Model as your database structure
2. View (C in MVC) ‚Äì The Logic Layer - This is the controller part in traditional MVC. It handles user requests and talks to the model to get data.
3. Template (V in MVC) ‚Äì The UI Layer - This is what the user sees. The HTML with some dynamic data.
