Memory Component 
----------------
Working - [similar to human short-term memory]
        - It coordinates information flow between various memory systems.
Episodic
Semantic
Procedural memory - differ from other memory
Semantic memory
Dynamic Few-Shot Prompting 


Simulate human-like problem-solving and contextual understanding,
**Utimately improving AI interactions and learning from past experiences

Working Memory
- Working memory is the first type of memory explored, crucial for maintaining context during interactions
- The AI assistant's working memory is built by appending user messages to a list, allowing for continuous updates and context retrieval during conversations
Episodic Memory [Part of long-term explicit memory] [comprises a personâ€™s unique recollection of experiences, events, and situations]
- Episodic memory captures historical experiences and their takeaways, allowing chatbots to learn from past interactions. 
- Episodic memory enables the AI to recall past interactions
- Extracting valuable insights and learnings that inform its responses in future conversations.
- This leads to more personalized and contextually aware responses
- By using Vector databases for semantic recall, the system can store and retrieve episodic memories efficiently
- The **dynamic modification of system prompts helps integrate the latest memories into conversations, ensuring that past interactions inform current discussions effectively.
This enables better contextualization in future conversations.
Semantic Memory
- Semantic memory provides knowledge context and factual grounding, essential for effective communication
Dynamic Few-shot Prompting 
- Dynamic **few-shot prompting helps the AI generate relevant responses by automatically providing successful examples and instructions based on prior interactions
Procedural Memory 
- Procedural memory is distinct from other memory types, focusing on how we remember to perform tasks without conscious recall.
- This memory type enables the execution of complex actions automatically.
- Examples of procedural memory include riding a bike or typing, activities we perform **unconsciously.
- These tasks demonstrate our ability to remember actions without active thought.
- Implementing procedural memory in AI involves fine-tuning language models, which can be complex and time-consuming. This process requires updating the core code to enhance system behavior.
- Research in AI has explored systems like **retrospective language models that internalize memories for improved responses.
  - These innovations aim to enhance the learning capabilities of language models.

Steps for Memories in Conversation
- The conversational flow utilizes episodic memory to enhance interactions, allowing the AI to remember past user inputs for more personalized responses. This dynamic updating process improves the user experience by retaining context across conversations.
- **The system converts working memory into episodic memory at the **end of conversations, ensuring that relevant information is stored for future reference. This process allows for continuity in user interactions.

1.Working memory acts as the immediate cognitive workspace.
   - conversational context observed through real-time interactions
   - Remembering and Learning from Short-Term memory 

    Learning from short-term memory - dynamic integration of new messages into the active context 
      - Updating the stateful representation of the entire conversation 
2.Episodic memory retains historical experiences and insights.
    - essentially being able to recall over a series of Prior Working Memory 
    - Included Raw Conversations, 
    - Included Analytical Understanding from raw data
   - Remembering in episodic memory - done with few-shot prompting 
   - Learning from past recall as well - 
     - Two Processes 
     Automatic Storage of past complete conversation 
     Generation of Post Conversation Analysis 
3.Semantic memory provides a representation of knowledge separate from personal experiences, enabling models to access explicit facts that ground their responses and integrate dynamic knowledge.
4.Procedural memory encompasses the model's weights and code structure, influencing how other memory systems operate and fundamentally altering the agent's functional behavior.

Understanding different memory systems can significantly enhance the **cognitive capabilities of language models
Implementing advanced **cognitive architectures can lead to better contextualization in language models, addressing limitations commonly found in less complex systems.
