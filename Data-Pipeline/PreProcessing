Steps in Docling 
1. OCR Model downloading on Top of the Document 
2. Need Hardware Dependencies Accelerator 

How Going to Setup the Production Pipeline for this Docling  - Azure Service 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.To containerize Docling and run it on Azure Machine Learning (AML) Compute as a Docker-based job, follow these steps
2.This is the most scalable and reproducible method for running complex dependency-heavy pipelines like Docling's preprocessing + Markdown output generation

3.Create Dockerfile for Docling
This will define all dependencies including CUDA (for GPU), OCR tools, and Hugging Face model handling.
# Use a CUDA-enabled base image (adjust CUDA version as needed)
FROM nvidia/cuda:11.8.0-cudnn8-runtime-ubuntu22.04

# Set non-interactive frontend
ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive

# Install system dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    python3-pip python3-dev python3-venv \
    git wget curl \
    tesseract-ocr \
    libgl1-mesa-glx \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Set up Python
RUN ln -s /usr/bin/python3 /usr/bin/python

# Upgrade pip
RUN pip install --upgrade pip

# Install Python libraries
RUN pip install \
    torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118 \
    transformers \
    opencv-python \
    pytesseract \
    docling

# Set workdir and copy code
WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app

# Entrypoint for preprocessing
CMD ["python", "run_docling.py"]

4.2. Create Your run_docling.py Script
This should run Docling on an input (e.g. PDF or image) and output Markdown.
import docling

# Adjust paths as needed
input_file = "input_data/scanned.pdf"
output_file = "output_data/processed.md"

doc = docling.Document(input_file)
doc.preprocess()
doc.export(output_file, format="markdown")

5.3. Build & Push Docker Image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)
Assuming your ACR name is myacr:
# Login to ACR
az acr login --name myacr

# Tag and push Docker image
docker build -t docling-preprocess .
docker tag docling-preprocess myacr.azurecr.io/docling-preprocess:v1
docker push myacr.azurecr.io/docling-preprocess:v1

6.Run on Azure ML
Use the Azure ML SDK or CLI to submit the job using the Docker image.

from azure.ai.ml import MLClient
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.ai.ml.entities import Environment, CommandJob
from azure.ai.ml.entities import AmlCompute

# Connect to workspace
ml_client = MLClient(DefaultAzureCredential(), "<subscription_id>", "<resource_group>", "<workspace_name>")

# Define compute cluster
compute_name = "gpu-cluster"

# Define environment from Docker
env = Environment(
    name="docling-env",
    image="myacr.azurecr.io/docling-preprocess:v1"
)

# Define job
job = CommandJob(
    code="./",  # location of script
    command="python run_docling.py",
    environment=env,
    compute=compute_name,
    display_name="docling-preprocess-job",
    experiment_name="docling-experiment",
    inputs={},
    outputs={}
)

ml_client.jobs.create_or_update(job)

7.5. Monitor & Retrieve Output
You can stream logs using:
az ml job show --name <job-name>
az ml job download --name <job-name> --output ./outputs
If saving to outputs/processed.md, Azure ML will automatically track and store that in the job's artifacts.
8.Tips for Better Performance & Usability
Model Caching: Pre-download Hugging Face models and mount them via Azure Blob Storage or include them in the container.
Multiple File Support: Extend your script to process a directory of files.
Use Volume Mounts: If working with large datasets, consider mounting datasets using Azure ML Datasets or Datastores.

--------------------------------------------------------
1) Deploying the Container in Production with Django Backend
Option A: Trigger Azure ML job from Django
Your Django backend can call the Azure ML REST API or use the Azure SDK to dynamically launch a job each time a file is uploaded.
File is uploaded (e.g. to Azure Blob).
Django captures the upload event.
Django launches a job by calling AML with that file as input.

from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.ai.ml import MLClient
from azure.ai.ml.entities import CommandJob

ml_client = MLClient(DefaultAzureCredential(), "sub_id", "rg", "ws")

def start_docling_job(input_path):
    job = CommandJob(
        code="./",
        command=f"python run_docling.py --input_path {input_path}",
        environment="azureml:docling-env@latest",
        compute="gpu-cluster",
        display_name="docling-job",
        experiment_name="docling-experiment"
    )
    ml_client.jobs.create_or_update(job)

2) 2) Using Azure Functions to Trigger Container Execution
Also yes ‚Äî Azure Functions can act as a serverless trigger, which is ideal for event-driven jobs (like new file arrival).
A file is uploaded to Azure Blob Storage.
Blob Trigger on an Azure Function is fired.
The Azure Function starts the Azure ML job with the container.

[File Upload to Blob Storage] ---> [Azure Function Triggered] ---> [Start AML Job with Container]

import logging
import azure.functions as func
from azure.ai.ml import MLClient
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.ai.ml.entities import CommandJob

def main(myblob: func.InputStream):
    ml_client = MLClient(DefaultAzureCredential(), "sub_id", "rg", "ws")
    
    job = CommandJob(
        code="./",
        command=f"python run_docling.py --input_path {myblob.name}",
        environment="azureml:docling-env@latest",
        compute="gpu-cluster"
    )
    ml_client.jobs.create_or_update(job)

‚û°Ô∏è Pro: Auto-scaled, lightweight, and event-driven. No need for Django to manage job scheduling.
‚û°Ô∏è Con: Requires proper blob path and possibly a shared location for input/output.




-----Pre Baking all the containers----------------------------
okay fine, 
docker file have dependencies right, to install , like docling, transformers, hugging face, installation, how I can pre installed all the libraries for the container, so that when file comes each time it will trigger the ml job to pre process 


ChatGPT said:
Perfect ‚Äî you're on the right track. To pre-install all dependencies so they don‚Äôt re-download every time the Azure ML job runs, you must bake everything into your Docker image during the image build process.

Here‚Äôs a fully optimized strategy to do exactly that üëá

‚úÖ Goals:
Include Docling, Transformers, OCR libs, etc.

Pre-download Hugging Face models into the image.

Push the container once to Azure Container Registry (ACR).

Reuse the image with zero download latency on every job.

üì¶ 1. Updated Optimized Dockerfile
dockerfile
Copy
Edit
# CUDA-based base image with Python
FROM nvidia/cuda:11.8.0-cudnn8-runtime-ubuntu22.04

ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive

# Install base dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    python3-pip python3-dev python3-venv \
    git wget curl \
    tesseract-ocr \
    libgl1-mesa-glx \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Link python
RUN ln -s /usr/bin/python3 /usr/bin/python

# Upgrade pip
RUN pip install --upgrade pip

# Install Python packages
RUN pip install \
    torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118 \
    transformers \
    opencv-python \
    pytesseract \
    docling \
    onnxruntime-gpu

# Pre-download Hugging Face models
RUN python -c "from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer; \
    AutoModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased'); \
    AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')"

# Optional: Download any OCR/DOC models used by Docling if possible
# You may need to inspect docling's codebase or docs to locate those URLs

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy preprocessing script into the container
COPY run_docling.py .

CMD ["python", "run_docling.py"]
üìÅ 2. Add File: run_docling.py (can be static or param-driven)
python
Copy
Edit
import docling
import os

# Example hardcoded path ‚Äî you can parametrize via env vars
input_file = "input_data/scanned.pdf"
output_file = "output_data/processed.md"

doc = docling.Document(input_file)
doc.preprocess()
doc.export(output_file, format="markdown")
üöÄ 3. Build and Push the Container to ACR
bash
Copy
Edit
# Login to your Azure Container Registry (ACR)
az acr login --name <your-acr-name>

# Build the image
docker build -t docling-preprocess:latest .

# Tag it with ACR path
docker tag docling-preprocess:latest <your-acr-name>.azurecr.io/docling-preprocess:v1

# Push the image to ACR
docker push <your-acr-name>.azurecr.io/docling-preprocess:v1
üìÇ 4. Use the Container in Azure ML Job
In your Azure ML job definition (YAML or SDK), use:

yaml
Copy
Edit
environment:
  image: <your-acr-name>.azurecr.io/docling-preprocess:v1
Now:

The container is pre-baked with all dependencies and models.

Each job is just:

Spin container

Mount inputs

Run

Exit

No re-downloading of models or packages. ‚ö°

üìå Pro Tips
Add --cache-dir and set Hugging Face to offline mode in the script if you want no internet at all.

You can mount external inputs/outputs in your Azure ML job, so only data moves ‚Äî container stays static.

Would you like a downloadable, complete template repo (Dockerfile + script + job config) in ZIP or GitHub link?


----------------------------
Multiple Files 
I have multiple files to preprocess, each time job will trigger, so each time dependencies will run from the docker file ? to run the job ?


ChatGPT said:
Excellent question ‚Äî and a critical one for performance and cost-efficiency in production.

‚ùìDoes each Azure ML job re-run the Docker container from scratch?
‚úÖ Short Answer:
Yes, each time a job is triggered in Azure ML, the platform pulls the Docker image, starts a fresh container, and executes the command inside it. This includes installing models or setting up dependencies unless already baked into the container.

üí° Optimization Strategies for Your Use Case
If you're processing multiple files individually, triggering a full container spin-up every time is inefficient. Here's how to optimize:

‚úÖ 1. Bake All Heavy Dependencies Into the Docker Image
Include:

Pre-installed OCR/ML libraries

Hugging Face models (if fixed)

CUDA/PyTorch/Tesseract

Dockerfile
Copy
Edit
# Pre-download Hugging Face models
RUN python -c "from transformers import AutoModel; AutoModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')"
‚è± Result: No need to download models at runtime ‚Üí faster startup.

‚úÖ 2. Use Azure ML Parallel Batch Inference (if files are many)
Instead of launching one job per file, you can:

Submit one job to Azure ML with a directory of files.

Use ParallelRunStep or Batch Endpoint to parallelize processing.

Benefits:
Only one container spin-up.

Faster processing via concurrency.

Ideal if files arrive in batches.

‚úÖ 3. Use Long-Running Service Instead (Advanced)
If your use case demands ultra-low latency:

Deploy Docling as a containerized web API (e.g., on Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure Container Apps, or App Service with GPU).

Django/Function sends a request for each file ‚Üí immediate processing.

‚è± Result: Always-on container, sub-second response time.

‚úÖ Summary
Option	Startup Time	Cost Efficiency	Ideal Use Case
One job per file	Medium‚ÄìHigh	üü† Moderate	Occasional triggers
Batch job (ParallelRun)	Low (1x start)	‚úÖ High	High volume, batched files
Long-running container API	‚úÖ Low	üü† Depends	Real-time or near-real-time needs

Would you prefer to batch files together in one job or explore long-running container deployment?

--------------
pre Installed 
Oh, when docker file is build and push to the container image, it will have already all dependencies to run , just spinning the container with the compute in ml job ? 


ChatGPT said:
‚úÖ Exactly right!

Once your Docker image is built and pushed to Azure Container Registry (ACR) with all dependencies and models already inside, then every time an Azure ML job runs:

üí° What Happens on Each Job Trigger?
Azure ML pulls your pre-built Docker image from ACR (cached if previously used on the compute node).

It spins up a container on the selected compute (e.g., GPU VM).

It runs your script inside the container ‚Äî no need to install anything again.

Inputs (like PDF/image files) and outputs (like Markdown) are mounted into the container automatically.

‚úÖ Benefits:
üöÄ Fast startup time (no pip install, no model downloads).

üîÅ Reusable across many jobs ‚Äî even thousands of files.

üí∞ Cost-efficient ‚Äî pay only for compute, not setup time.

üîí Stable environment ‚Äî same version of everything each time.

üìå Summary:
Step	One-Time or Per Job?	Notes
Docker build (with deps)	‚úÖ One-time	Done locally, then pushed to ACR
Container spin-up	üîÅ Per job	Fast because image is pre-built
Dependency setup	‚ùå Already inside	Nothing extra is installed at runtime
File input/output mount	üîÅ Per job	Azure ML handles this automatically

You're now ready to run Docling preprocessing at scale with minimal latency.

Would you like a full deployment checklist or Terraform/Bicep snippet to automate the entire pipeline (ACR + ML job + trigger)?

---------
Absolutely! To automate your Docling preprocessing pipeline on Azure, you can leverage Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Bicep or Terraform. This approach ensures consistent, repeatable deployments and streamlines the management of your Azure resources.

üöÄ Deployment Checklist: Automating Docling Preprocessing on Azure
1. Containerize Your Docling Application
Dockerfile: Ensure your Dockerfile includes all necessary dependencies, such as Docling, Transformers, and any OCR libraries.

Pre-download Models: Incorporate commands to pre-download any models or data required at runtime to avoid delays during job execution.

2. Push Docker Image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)
Build and Tag Image:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker build -t docling-preprocess:latest .
docker tag docling-preprocess:latest <your-acr-name>.azurecr.io/docling-preprocess:v1
Push to ACR:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker push <your-acr-name>.azurecr.io/docling-preprocess:v1
3. Define Azure Resources Using Bicep or Terraform
Azure Machine Learning Workspace: Set up a workspace to manage experiments, models, and deployments.

Compute Resources: Provision compute targets (e.g., GPU clusters) for running your jobs.

Storage Accounts: Create storage accounts for input/output data.
DevOps.dev

Container Registry: Ensure your ACR is accessible by the ML workspace.

4. Create Azure ML Job Definition
Command Job YAML: Define a YAML file specifying the command to run, inputs/outputs, environment (Docker image), and compute target.

Bicep/Terraform Integration: Use deployment scripts or modules to deploy the job definition as part of your infrastructure.

5. Set Up Triggers for Job Execution
Azure Functions: Implement a function that triggers on events (e.g., file upload to Blob Storage) and submits the ML job.

Event Grid: Configure Event Grid to listen for storage events and invoke your Azure Function accordingly.

6. Implement CI/CD Pipelines
Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions: Set up pipelines to automate the build and deployment of your infrastructure and application code.

Cluster Spin up Time 
so when ever the ML job is triggering, 
it will spin the compute cluster, how much time it will take ?


ChatGPT said:
Great follow-up question! When you trigger a Machine Learning job in Azure, especially one that uses a GPU-based compute cluster, the time it takes to spin up the compute cluster can vary based on several factors. Let‚Äôs break this down:

1. How long does it take to spin up an Azure ML Compute Cluster?
Factors Influencing the Spin-up Time:
Cluster Type:

Standard CPU clusters are typically quicker to spin up compared to GPU-based clusters.

Pre-provisioned clusters (with VMs already running) are faster than clusters that require on-demand provisioning.

VM Size and Configuration: The larger and more powerful the VM, the longer it might take to provision (though GPU VMs are generally provisioned faster than general-purpose ones).

Azure Region: Availability of resources in a specific region can affect provisioning time.

Typical Spin-up Times:
On-Demand GPU Cluster: Between 5 to 15 minutes.

This is the time it will take for the cluster to be fully provisioned and ready for running the job. Azure ML will allocate VMs, install necessary software (if required), and ensure everything is in place.

Pre-Provisioned Cluster: Between 1 to 5 minutes.

If you have a cluster that's always running, the job just schedules a task on an available VM, and the job starts almost immediately. But this depends on the cluster's load and VM availability.

Job Initialization Time: After the cluster is ready, the job itself (container) may take another 1-2 minutes to start running, especially if it involves heavy libraries like PyTorch or TensorFlow that load models or have dependencies.

2. How Can You Minimize Job Startup Time?
A. Use Pre-Provisioned (Always-On) Clusters
Azure ML Compute allows you to create a "dedicated compute cluster" where the VMs remain running even if no jobs are actively running. This way, when a job triggers, the cluster is already ready, reducing spin-up time to just a few minutes.

Best for high-frequency jobs or workloads that need to minimize latency.

**B. Use Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
AKS can be used to host containers in a Kubernetes environment and supports autoscaling. This could allow for faster scaling, and if containers are pre-warmed (in a ready state), job execution can be faster.

Containerized jobs can be prepared in AKS for immediate execution once a trigger occurs.

C. Optimize Your Docker Container
Make sure your Docker image is as optimized as possible. For example:

Use a smaller base image.

Ensure that all dependencies are pre-installed (e.g., Hugging Face models, Tesseract, etc.).

This helps reduce the container's start time after the cluster is spun up.

**D. Consider using Batch Endpoints or Parallel Run Steps
For large workloads, you can use Batch Endpoints in Azure ML, which can be optimized for multiple file processing with concurrent job execution. This reduces overhead by processing many files with fewer cluster spin-up events.

3. How to Check Cluster Spin-Up Time?
You can monitor the cluster provisioning time using the Azure ML SDK or Azure Portal. Here's how:

Azure ML SDK Example:

python
Copy
Edit
from azure.ai.ml import MLClient
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from datetime import datetime

# Connect to Azure ML
ml_client = MLClient(DefaultAzureCredential(), "<subscription_id>", "<resource_group>", "<workspace_name>")

# Get cluster info
cluster = ml_client.compute.get("<compute_name>")
print(cluster.provisioning_state)
print(cluster.provisioning_duration)  # If available
Azure Portal: You can monitor compute instances in the Azure ML Studio. The portal shows provisioning time, as well as job execution metrics.

4. How Much Time Will the ML Job Take (After Cluster Spin-Up)?
Once the cluster is provisioned and your job starts, the actual processing time will depend on:

Job Complexity: The type of processing (e.g., OCR + model inference) and the number of files.

File Size: Larger files will take more time to process.

Compute Power: The specs of the VMs in the compute cluster.

Summary of Expected Timings
Event	Estimated Time
Spin-Up GPU Cluster	5 to 15 minutes
Spin-Up CPU Cluster	2 to 5 minutes
Pre-Provisioned Cluster	1 to 5 minutes
Container Start-up Time	1 to 2 minutes
Job Execution	Depends on workload and file size

By pre-provisioning the cluster or using AKS and optimizing your container, you can minimize latency and make your preprocessing pipeline efficient for high-frequency processing. Would you like more details on setting up pre-provisioned clusters or AKS for job speed-up?

Running Remote Hosted VLM 
------------
okay now I prepared the Docling in container to run the script to preprocess, but that is docling using default pipeline inside what they set up. 
So all the models downloading locally and running on preprocessing stage

ChatGPT said:
Great ‚Äî you've now reached the remote VLM (Vision-Language Model) setup phase for Docling, which means you're shifting inference from local models to remote APIs like Ollama or Watsonx. This has direct implications on:

Container image creation

Script execution

Environment variables/secrets

Networking (API access)

Let‚Äôs break it down for you clearly:

‚úÖ 1. What's Changing in Your Setup
From:
Heavy container with local models downloaded and run at preprocessing time.

To:
Lightweight container that sends OCR/image data to remote APIs (Ollama or Watsonx) for inference and gets back results in Markdown.

üß± 2. Changes in Docker Image Creation
‚úÖ What stays the same:
You still need basic Python + docling + transformers + HTTP support.

You do not need to install/download models locally anymore (no heavy OCR/transformer downloads).

üö´ What you can now remove:
Model download steps in Dockerfile (AutoModel.from_pretrained, etc.)

Onnx, GPU dependencies ‚Äî unless needed by other parts.

‚ú® Example Updated Dockerfile (Minimal for Remote VLM):
Dockerfile
Copy
Edit
FROM python:3.10-slim

WORKDIR /app

# System dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    tesseract-ocr \
    libglib2.0-0 libsm6 libxext6 libxrender-dev \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Install Python dependencies
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy script
COPY run_docling_remote.py .

# Set environment (or use runtime override)
ENV WX_API_KEY=your_key_here
ENV WX_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here

CMD ["python", "run_docling_remote.py"]
üìÑ 3. Your Python Script (run_docling_remote.py)
Looks good! Make sure:

.env is either loaded from mounted volume or set via environment variables.

You uncomment the VLM option that matches your service (Ollama or Watsonx).

üîë For secrets:
If using Azure ML, you can:

Use Azure ML Environment Variables

Use Key Vault integration for secure storage

üåç 4. Networking Requirements
If you're calling:

Ollama (localhost:11434) ‚Üí container must be on same VM or host network

Watsonx (external HTTPS) ‚Üí container must allow outbound HTTP/S access

‚úÖ Azure ML allows outbound HTTP by default.
So Watsonx works without changes.

If you‚Äôre calling Ollama running outside Azure, you need:

Public IP + open port

Or, a custom VNET with peered resources

üß† 5. Triggering from Azure ML: No Big Change
Azure ML will:

Spin the container

Pass input file

Run your script

Output the markdown file

You're simply replacing local model usage with remote inference logic, which makes the image:

Lighter

Faster to spin

More scalable

‚úÖ Summary: What to Change for Remote VLM Pipeline
Component	Change Needed?	What to Do
Dockerfile	‚úÖ Yes	Remove model downloads, keep Docling, add HTTP libraries
Python Script	‚úÖ Yes	Use VlmPipelineOptions with API configs as you posted
Environment	‚úÖ Yes	Inject secrets (WX_API_KEY, WX_PROJECT_ID) via env vars or Azure Key Vault
Azure ML Job	‚ùå No major change	Same job setup, just use new container image and updated script
Network Access	‚ö†Ô∏è Possibly	Ensure outbound HTTPS access for Watsonx; or internal access for Ollama

Would you like me to generate:

A clean, minimal Dockerfile + requirements.txt for this setup?

Or an Azure ML job YAML to run this container with environment secrets?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

okay now im choosing which VLM setup from docling right, 
that script will be in the running script ?


ChatGPT said:
Yes ‚Äî exactly. The VLM setup selection (Ollama or Watsonx) happens within your running script, and you control it through code and environment variables. Here‚Äôs how it fits in:

‚úÖ Where Does the VLM Setup Happen?
It happens in the Python script that you're running as the entry point of the container (e.g., run_docling_remote.py). This script includes logic like:

python
Copy
Edit
pipeline_options = VlmPipelineOptions(enable_remote_services=True)

# Choose VLM backend ‚Äî Ollama or Watsonx
pipeline_options.vlm_options = ollama_vlm_options(
    model="granite3.2-vision:2b",
    prompt="OCR the full page to markdown.",
)

# OR
# pipeline_options.vlm_options = watsonx_vlm_options(
#     model="ibm/granite-vision-3-2-2b", 
#     prompt="OCR the full page to markdown."
# )
So yes, the selection of which VLM service to use is done in the script you run inside the container.

üîÑ Dynamic Switching (Optional)
If you want to switch models dynamically based on input (like env vars or CLI flags), you can modify the script like this:

python
Copy
Edit
import os

vlm_provider = os.getenv("VLM_PROVIDER", "ollama")

if vlm_provider == "ollama":
    pipeline_options.vlm_options = ollama_vlm_options(
        model="granite3.2-vision:2b", prompt="OCR the full page to markdown."
    )
elif vlm_provider == "watsonx":
    pipeline_options.vlm_options = watsonx_vlm_options(
        model="ibm/granite-vision-3-2-2b", prompt="OCR the full page to markdown."
    )
else:
    raise ValueError("Invalid VLM provider specified.")
Then at runtime, just pass:

bash
Copy
Edit
VLM_PROVIDER=watsonx python run_docling_remote.py
Or define VLM_PROVIDER in your Azure ML job/environment.

‚úÖ Final Flow Recap
You build the container once with this script included.

Azure ML job spins up, runs your script (CMD ["python", "run_docling_remote.py"])

The script:

Reads VLM_PROVIDER or similar setting

Chooses the remote API setup

Sends your document for inference

Outputs Markdown

Would you like me to help you rewrite your script to support this dynamic model switching via environment variable?


Docker Image Doubt
-------
how this command using in 
WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app

explain this how it is exactly using in docker file 
because Im not push in the application code in image, Only dependencies installing in image 


ChatGPT said:
Great question! Let‚Äôs break it down step by step with your context in mind:

These Dockerfile commands:
Dockerfile
Copy
Edit
WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app
do the following:

1. WORKDIR /app
This sets the working directory inside the Docker image to /app.

Any subsequent commands like COPY, RUN, CMD will be executed relative to this directory.

If /app doesn‚Äôt exist, Docker will create it.

Think of it like:

‚ÄúFrom now on, I‚Äôm working inside /app.‚Äù

2. COPY . /app
This copies everything (i.e. . = current directory where the Dockerfile lives) from your local machine into the /app directory inside the image.

This includes your application code, by default.

But You Mentioned:
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not pushing the application code in image, only dependencies installing in image.‚Äù

This means you're likely doing one of the following instead:

Building a base image with only dependencies, not the full app.

Mounting your source code at runtime using a Docker volume (e.g., with docker run -v or docker-compose volumes).

If You Don‚Äôt Want to Include Your Code in the Image:
Then you should avoid using COPY . /app in that Dockerfile. Instead, your Dockerfile might look more like:

Dockerfile
Copy
Edit
FROM node:18

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
This will:

Copy only your package.json and package-lock.json

Install dependencies

Not copy your app code

Then, during development, you‚Äôd use volume mounting like:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker run -v $(pwd):/app my-image
So your code is used by the container but not baked into the image.

Would you like help modifying your Dockerfile to follow this approach?

run_script.py 
-------
could you please this in docker file, how it is using ?
WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app



ChatGPT said:
Absolutely ‚Äî here's how your Dockerfile should be structured to support your remote VLM-based Docling pipeline, using environment variables (like VLM_PROVIDER) to switch between Ollama and Watsonx during runtime.

üß† How Azure ML Will Use This
Azure ML will build this image once (or you build and push it to ACR).

Then every time the ML job is triggered:

It spins the container

Runs run_docling_remote.py

Based on the VLM_PROVIDER environment variable, it will pick Ollama or Watsonx

It uses the corresponding remote endpoint for inference (no heavy local model download)
