What is Integration Testing 


ChatGPT said:
Integration Testing is a type of software testing where individual units or components of a software application are combined and tested as a group. The goal is to verify that different modules or services used by your application interact correctly with each other.

üîç In Simple Terms:
Once developers write and test individual units (e.g., methods, functions, or modules), Integration Testing checks that those units work together properly.

‚úÖ Why It‚Äôs Important:
Catches issues in data flow or interface mismatches between modules.

Verifies that communication between systems (e.g., frontend to backend, or Java service to a mainframe system) happens as expected.

Ensures end-to-end functionality across integrated components before full system testing.

üîó Examples:
Java & Mainframe Integration

Suppose a Java application sends a payment instruction to a mainframe system using MQ. Integration Testing checks if the message format is correct, the message reaches the mainframe, and the mainframe responds as expected.

Database Interaction:

You test whether the application writes data to or reads data from the database correctly after integration.

Microservices Communication:

If one service fetches trade details and another settles them, integration testing ensures that they communicate and share data correctly.

üîÑ Typical Integration Testing Scenarios:
Calling APIs and checking responses.

Validating interaction between front-end and back-end.

Verifying file transfers or MQ message flows.

Testing jobs that read from one module and update another.

Let me know if you'd like an example from your Mainframe + Java migration project ‚Äî I can explain it in that context too.

What is the Functional Testing


ChatGPT said:
‚úÖ What is Functional Testing?
Functional Testing is a type of software testing that focuses on verifying that the software system behaves according to the defined requirements or specifications. It tests what the system does, not how it does it.

üîç In Simple Terms:
Functional Testing checks if the application is doing what it‚Äôs supposed to do ‚Äî that is, whether each feature or function works correctly based on business logic or user requirements.

üß™ Key Focus:
Business rules and logic

User commands and inputs

APIs and data flow

Interfaces and outputs

üîß Example (Relevant to Your Work in BFSI):
Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre working on a settlement processing module:

Requirement: "If trade type = 'BUY', then system should debit account A and credit account B."

Functional Test: You test this specific scenario and validate whether the expected debit/credit happens correctly for different trade types.

üìå Common Functional Tests:
Input validation:
Does the system accept/reject inputs based on rules?

Button or screen actions:
When a user clicks ‚ÄúSubmit Payment,‚Äù does the transaction happen and confirmation appear?

Database interactions:
When you process a trade, does the system write the correct settlement records?

Business rules:
Are SWIFT messages generated in the correct format for international payments?

üß∞ Tools Commonly Used:
Manual testing using test cases

Automation tools like Selenium, JUnit, or domain-specific tools

üë®‚Äçüíº In BFSI Projects (like yours):
You would perform Functional Testing to:

Validate trade processing and settlement logic

Test payment netting calculations

Ensure accurate SWIFT message generation

Confirm that migrated Java modules behave like the old Mainframe logic

Let me know if you'd like sample test cases or want this tailored to your current TCS project.




You said:
I have 70 % accuracy in retrieval , and did some enhancement and then i am achieving accuracy by 40%, what is this mean


ChatGPT said:
Great question ‚Äî let‚Äôs clarify what's happening here.

üß† You said:
You had 70% accuracy in retrieval.

After enhancements, you're now achieving accuracy by 40%.

This statement is a bit ambiguous, so let‚Äôs explore what it could mean based on how it's worded:

‚ùì 1. Do you mean your accuracy dropped to 40%?
If that's the case, then:

After enhancement, accuracy dropped from 70% to 40%, which is a decrease in performance ‚Äî not good.

In that case, your enhancement negatively impacted retrieval accuracy, and you might want to debug or revert the changes.

‚úÖ 2. Do you mean you improved accuracy by 40% (on top of 70%)?
If so, this is more positive and might mean:

You improved the accuracy from 70% to 98% ‚Äî because 40% of 70% is 28%, and 70% + 28% = 98%.

However, this would typically be phrased as:

‚ÄúI improved the retrieval accuracy by 40% from the original 70%, reaching 98%.‚Äù

üîç To Be Clear and Professional in Your Resume or Communication:
Depending on what you meant, you could write:

‚úÖ If accuracy improved from 70% to 98%:
Enhanced the retrieval logic, resulting in a 40% improvement over the original 70% accuracy, achieving 98% accuracy.

‚ùå If accuracy decreased to 40%:
You may need to rework the enhancement, or rephrase if that‚Äôs not what you intended.

Let me know your exact numbers, and I can help you write it accurately for your resume or report.
