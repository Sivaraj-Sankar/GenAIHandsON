UILogic for Highlighting:

Store metadata (document, chunk page, bounding boxes).

In UI, upon returning citations, highlight the text snippet in a PDF viewer, and link to page view.

üì∫ Implementation Walkthrough
Here‚Äôs an excellent video walkthrough covering RAG over complex PDFs‚Äîparsing, indexing, retrieval, LLM response, and UI integration with highlights:


‚úÖ Step-by-Step Development Outline
Data Ingestion & Parsing

Accept PDFs via upload, parse with PyMuPDF/OCR, extract layout + chunk metadata.

Chunking & Embeddings

Split by logical units (headings/tables), embed text + image sections, optionally at multiple granularities.

Index Setup

Insert embeddings into a vector store, add BM25 for hybrid search.

Retrieval + Rerank

Classify queries, retrieve top‚Äëk candidates (vector + BM25), rerank, pass chunks to LLM.

Generate with Citation

Use tool-calling or post-processing (e.g. CiteFix) to ensure accurate citations tied to chunk metadata.

Display & Highlight

In the UI: generate response with citation links ‚Üí display PDF ‚Üí scroll and highlight text with clickable navigation.

Optimize & Scale

Parallelize embedding/index pipelines; quantize indexes; tune chunk size and retrieval parameters based on metrics; automate evaluation.

‚úÖ Summary of Tools & Best Practices
Component	Recommended Tools & Techniques
PDF Parsing	PyMuPDF, pdfplumber, Tesseract/OCR, ChatDOC parser
Chunking	LangChain RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter, logic-based block splitting
Embeddings	Text: OpenAI Ada/MPNet; Image: CLIP/LayoutLM
Indexing	FAISS with IVF/PQ, Pinecone, Weaviate (hybrid)
Retrieval	Vector + BM25 hybrid, query classification/reranking
Citations	LangChain tool-calling, CiteFix post-processing
UI	PDF renderer with highlight overlay and navigation links
Scale & Performance	Ray/Anyscale for workers, GPU indexing, async fetch, benchmarks

By combining multimodal chunk processing, structured citation strategies, and UI-integrated PDF highlighting, you can build a robust, trustworthy RAG app ready for production. If you'd like code samples or help choosing specific frameworks, I‚Äôd be happy to dive deeper!

What are the Evaluation Techniques for RAG application


ChatGPT said:
Evaluating a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system is critical to ensuring high-quality, factually grounded, and relevant answers. Evaluation can be done automatically, manually, or using hybrid methods.

Here‚Äôs a clear breakdown of the main evaluation techniques:

‚úÖ 1. Retrieval Evaluation
Focuses on whether the retriever is finding relevant information.

üìå Metrics:
Recall@k: Fraction of queries for which a relevant document is in the top-k results.

Precision@k: Fraction of the top-k retrieved documents that are relevant.

Hit Rate: Whether at least one relevant passage was retrieved.

Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR): Measures rank position of the first relevant document.

nDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain): Considers relevance and rank position.

üß™ Tools:
Annotate relevant contexts for each query (gold passages).

Use vector similarity benchmarks (if using dense retrieval).

‚úÖ 2. Generation Evaluation
Focuses on how well the language model generates answers using retrieved content.

üìå Metrics:
Factuality / Faithfulness:

Does the output only use retrieved content?

Measured with:

SelfCheckGPT

LlamaIndex Eval

RAGAS Faithfulness Score

QAG (Question-Answer Generation) Consistency

Relevance:

Is the answer directly relevant to the user question?

Measured with:

Semantic similarity

BERTScore

Embedding-based cosine similarity

Correctness:

Does the output answer the question accurately?

Requires comparison to gold answers (manual or automatic via QA).

Fluency and Grammar:

Readability and coherence of the output.

BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR (but limited in open-ended QA tasks)

‚úÖ 3. End-to-End Task Evaluation
Measuring the entire RAG pipeline‚Äôs performance.

üìå Approaches:
Exact Match / F1 Score: Compare answers to ground-truth answers.

Human Evaluation: Rate on correctness, factuality, helpfulness.

QA over QA pairs: Generate question-answer pairs from documents and test if RAG recovers them.

Closed-book vs. RAG comparison: Measure performance improvement with RAG over pure LLM.

‚úÖ 4. RAG-Specific Frameworks
These tools help automate RAG evaluations:

Tool	Key Features
RAGAS	Measures faithfulness, answer relevance, context recall
TruLens	LLM-based evaluation with feedback tracking
LlamaIndex	Has built-in evaluation for context relevance and answer quality
LangChain evals	Supports custom criteria and LLM-based scoring
Promptfoo	Experiment tracking and scoring pipelines

üëÄ Real-World Strategy
In practice, a good evaluation pipeline looks like this:

Offline Retrieval Eval (Recall@k, etc.)

Answer Quality Eval:

Human-labeled or LLM-based scores for correctness/factuality.

Feedback Loop:

Logging real user queries, comparing LLM answers to retrieved context.

A/B Testing in production:

Compare different retrievers, chunking strategies, or prompt templates.
