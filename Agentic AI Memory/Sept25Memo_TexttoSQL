Denodo is a data virtualization platform.
Instead of physically moving or copying data into a single repository (like a data warehouse or data lake), Denodo lets you access, combine, and deliver data in real time from multiple heterogeneous sources (databases, APIs, cloud services, files, etc.) — as if it were a single unified source.

Key Features
Data Virtualization → Query data where it lives, no need for ETL pipelines.
Unified Data Layer → Exposes all enterprise data through a single semantic layer.
Real-Time Access → Data is retrieved and combined on demand.
Data Governance & Security → Centralized access control, auditing, and masking.
Connectivity → Works with relational DBs, NoSQL, cloud storage, REST/SOAP APIs, etc.
Performance → Query optimization, caching, and smart federation.

Typical Use Cases
Data Integration → Combine customer, sales, and product data from different systems.
BI & Analytics → Provide a single data access layer for reporting tools (Tableau, Power BI, etc.).
Data Services → Deliver enterprise data as APIs (REST/GraphQL).
Cloud & Hybrid Data Management → Unify on-prem and cloud data without replication.

Benefits
Faster time-to-insight (no heavy ETL pipelines).
Lower data duplication and storage costs.
Greater agility (data consumers don’t care where the data is stored).
Strong security & governance.

You can think of Denodo as a “virtual database” that doesn’t store data itself but connects and queries multiple data sources in real time.
Would you like me to also compare Denodo vs. a traditional Data Warehouse (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery)?
