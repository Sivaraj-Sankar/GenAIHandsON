ðŸ”§ Usage
The layout is now ready to use! The main App.tsx has been updated to demonstrate the layout with a sample dashboard. You can:
Start the development server: npm start
View the application: The layout will be immediately visible
Test responsiveness: Resize the browser window
Test mobile: Use browser dev tools to simulate mobile devices
The layout provides a solid foundation for building out the specific features of your Ambient Agent UX platform. Each component is modular, well-documented, and follows React/TypeScript best practices.
Would you like me to create any additional components or make any adjustments to the existing layout?
