1. How I'm Going to Approach the Problem 
 
Phase 1: Problem Definition & Architecture
Define detection engineering lifecycle (rule creation, refinement, testing, deployment)
Identify gaps LLMs can fill: threat intelligence parsing, rule generation, anomaly summarization, etc.
Decide use case: Ambient Agent, Assistive Co-pilot, or Autonomous Agent
High-level architecture (LLM backend, security tools integration, feedback loop)

üß† Phase 2: LLM Capabilities for Detection Engineering
Use Cases:
Convert unstructured threat intel to structured rules (Sigma, YARA, KQL, SPL)
Auto-summarize threat alerts
Simulate attack scenarios and generate detections
Build detection-as-code assistant
Models: OpenAI (via Azure), Cohere, Claude, Mistral (self-hosted for sensitive data)

üèóÔ∏è Phase 3: System Design (Agentic and Ambient)
Agent Frameworks: CrewAI / LangGraph / AutoGen
Observability stack: LangSmith, OpenTelemetry, Grafana/Loki, Prometheus
CI/CD for Detection-as-Code (YARA/Sigma validation pipelines)
UI: Visual workflow + rule validation + alert simulation
Data: Threat intel feeds, SIEM logs, MITRE ATT&CK mapping

üîê Phase 4: Security, Compliance & Governance
Role-based Access Control (RBAC)
Prompt injection hardening
Logging & audit trails for AI agent decisions
Model privacy compliance (SOC2, HIPAA if needed)
