If you're building a persistent agent with memory and tool use:
Use the Assistants v2 API
Define tools (code_interpreter, browser, etc.)
Add files
Call the assistant with a thread

Tool Name	Purpose
python	For calculations, data parsing, charts
browser	For real-time web searches
image_analysis	For interpreting user-uploaded images
code_interpreter	Alias of python, for advanced data ops


Example Prompt
User: “How will summer energy usage in California compare to last year?”
Step-by-step tool workflow by o3:
Web search – o3 identifies and uses the browser tool to pull in public utility data.
Python execution – It writes and runs Python code to parse that data, build a time‑series forecast, and generate charts.
Analysis – It interprets the results, highlighting key factors (e.g. heatwaves, policy changes).
Reporting – The model presents a graph and narrative summary based on its findings.
This entire process—from search → code → output → reasoning—is orchestrated autonomously by o3 in a ~minute span

System 1 in LLMs - LLMs natively function like System 1, They generate quick, intuitive responses

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-symbolic_AI?utm_source=chatgpt.com
System 2 in LLMs [https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20372?utm_source=chatgpt.com]
To Handle Deliberate reasoning, LLMs adopt System 2-like techniques, such as: 
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting: models are guided to think step-by-step.
Branch-Solve-Merge (BSM):break tasks into parts, solve each, then combine.
System 2 Attention (S2A):focus on key context for accurate answers.
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), agentic architectures, reinforcement learning(RL) to refine reasoning
External tools like knowledge graphs or symbolic reasoning systems serve System 2
offering structured, transparent logic to support the LLM’s intuitive outputs
https://jaxon.ai/system-1-system-2/?utm_source=chatgpt.com

Some Frameworks go even further:
LLM2: combines a fast-generating LLM (System 1) with a “verifier” that judges outputs methodically (System 2), improving accuracy on tasks like math reasoning


A 2025 survey paper, "From System 1 to System 2: A Survey of Reasoning Large Language Models," highlights how foundational LLMs rely on fast intuition but evolve with System 2 techniques to handle reasoning with greater accuracy and reduced bias
Another study demonstrates a spectrum of reasoning alignment: System 2-aligned models do better on symbolic reasoning tasks, while System 1 excels in commonsense ones. Blending both creates more flexible models.
https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12470?utm_source=chatgpt.com
The concept of neuro-symbolic AI underscores this synergy—combining neural (System 1) and symbolic (System 2) reasoning—to reduce hallucinations and boost reliability.
Additionally, “System 2 distillation” techniques train System 1 models using high-quality System 2 outputs, enabling faster responses with improved reasoning—essentially compressing deep thought into intuition

MADLAD & Multilingual MT LMs 

3. Jules – Autonomous Agentic Coding Assistant
Jules – First unveiled in Google Labs around December 2024; entered public beta by mid-2025 and then generally available.
Functions autonomously: reads your repository, writes tests, fixes bugs, and suggests pull requests rather than inserting code directly.
Entirely powered by Gemini 2.5 Pro, leveraging its 1 million-token context window and reasoning capabilities. 
Introduced a “critic” feature: it reviews its own code proposals adversarially and iteratively improves them before presenting pull requests to the user. 



Gemini Code Assist & Gemini CLI (agentic tools integrated into IDEs and terminals)
Gemini Code Assist – Agent Mode – Released August 2025:
Embedded into IDEs like VS Code and IntelliJ, enabling multi-file edits, full project context, built-in tools, toolchain integration, and human-in-the-loop planning.
During use, the agent presents a plan before making changes, enabling guided, step-wise coding workflows. 


Gemini CLI – Released June 2025:
An open-source, terminal-based agent tool powered by Gemini 2.5 Pro, allowing natural language interaction with local codebases—covering code explanation, generation, debugging, and execution.
It also integrates multimedia generation (via Veo/Imagen), supports Model Context Protocol (MCP), and offers generous free usage quotas (~1,000 daily requests). 


1. CodeGemma Series (lightweight open code models)
CodeGemma – Launched around mid-2024, part of the open-source Gemma family.
Includes 2 billion and 7 billion parameter variants tuned for code tasks like generation, fill-in-the-middle completion, natural language understanding, and mathematical reasoning. 
These are decoder-only models (text-to-text and text-to-code), supporting multiple programming languages (e.g., Python, Java, C++). 


2. Gemini 2.5 Pro (advanced multimodal reasoning & coding model)
Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental – Introduced in March 2025.
A “thinking model” capable of reasoning through steps prior to producing outputs.
Demonstrates strong performance in code generation, including agentic code applications, scoring 63.8% on SWE-Bench Verified—an industry benchmark for agentic coding. 


Gemini 2.5 Pro (General Availability) – Launched by mid-2025 (around Google I/O and supporting production use).
Offers native multimodal input, long-context capability, Deep Think reasoning mode optimized for complex coding and creative tasks. 

AlphaEvolve – Evolutionary Agent for Algorithm Design
AlphaEvolve – Announced May 2025 by DeepMind:
A next-gen agentic system that autonomously evolves and refines algorithms using LLM capabilities (e.g., from Gemini) combined with evolutionary strategies.
Operates by generating variations of code and programmatically selecting the most effective ones using evaluation functions, aiming for minimal human oversight.
