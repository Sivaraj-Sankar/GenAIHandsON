                  gpt-4 November 2023 - A faster and more cost-effective version of GPT-4
                  gpt-4 Turbo 
                  gpt-4.5-Turbo 
                  gpt-4.1-turbo

                  handles text, image, and audio I/O, with support for function calling, JSON outputs, and a large 128 k token context window
                  GPT-4o - Multimodal(text,image,audio) - May 13 2024 - with larger context windows   - not a reasoning engine - but perform for reasoning 
                  GPT-4o-mini - July 18 2024 - Compact, Cheaper multimodal variant

                  All versions support a massive 1 million token context window, text + image, and excel in long-context understanding, coding, instruction-following, and vision benchmarks
                  Multimodality: strong image understanding (MMMU and Video‑MME) surpassing GPT‑4o
                  The GPT‑4.1 family is both reasoning-capable and multimodal, bridging powerful reasoning with massive context and image support
                  GPT-4.1 - April 14 2025 - New multimodal series outperforming GPT-4o in coding, long-context and cost
                  GPT-4.1 mini - April 14 2025
                  GPT-4.1-nano
                   These were designed with explicit private chain‑of‑thought and reasoning capabilities
                  o1-pro - March 2025 - Premium reasoning-capable model with high compute 
                  o1 - Full reasoning model Dec 2024   - solving 83% of IMO‑level math problems versus GPT‑4o’s 13%
                  GPT-4.5 - Orion - improved accuracy and conversational quality - general-purpose LLM, focused more on natural, emotionally intelligent conversation than on deep reasoning
                          - In direct reasoning tasks, GPT‑4o outperforms GPT‑4.5 in logic, multi-step reasoning, consistency, and self-correction
                          - GPT‑4.5 is multimodal-ish (text+image)
                  o1-mini - Sept 2024 First reasoning model

If you're building a persistent agent with memory and tool use:
Use the Assistants v2 API
Define tools (code_interpreter, browser, etc.)
Add files
Call the assistant with a thread

Tool Name	Purpose
python	For calculations, data parsing, charts
browser	For real-time web searches
image_analysis	For interpreting user-uploaded images
code_interpreter	Alias of python, for advanced data ops


Example Prompt
User: “How will summer energy usage in California compare to last year?”
Step-by-step tool workflow by o3:
Web search – o3 identifies and uses the browser tool to pull in public utility data.
Python execution – It writes and runs Python code to parse that data, build a time‑series forecast, and generate charts.
Analysis – It interprets the results, highlighting key factors (e.g. heatwaves, policy changes).
Reporting – The model presents a graph and narrative summary based on its findings.
This entire process—from search → code → output → reasoning—is orchestrated autonomously by o3 in a ~minute span
