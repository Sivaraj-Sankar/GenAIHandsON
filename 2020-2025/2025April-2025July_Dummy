        multiple tasks execute in parallel, is useful when you have I/O-bound tasks eg(making API requests calls, reading/writing
6) A Thread Pool is a collection of worker threads that can be used to execute tasks. When you create a ThreadPoolExecutor 
      executor.submit()
      executor.map() convenient way to apply a function to an iterable (like a list)
7) Creates the Context Manager using the get_openai_callback()
      Useful to track the usage, log responses or handle API Errors. 
      API Call time and any issues encountered during the API calls 
      Handle retries, manage, rate limits and track the number of tokens used

I apologize for the confusion. The last point regarding the net profit margin is incorrect.

Therefore, I cannot provide those details. If you have any other questions or need further information, please let me know!
