AI Apps 
Bolt - A website/e-commerce builder that takes your content, asset uploads, and Stripe API key, then generates a fully functional front‑end, cart, and checkout flow. Deployed easily via Netlify in under a day, even by coding novices
Google Stitch - Launched at Google I/O 2025, Stitch converts natural language or image prompts into UI designs and corresponding CSS/HTML or Figma files, with iterative conversational tuning
Figma MCP Server - Figma’s new Model Context Protocol (MCP) server enables AI tools (such as Copilot or Claude Code) to access detailed design information, improving accuracy when generating front-end code
Locofy.ai - 
AI generator that converts design files into production-ready, responsive frontend code (HTML/CSS/React/Vue) 
Anima - 
Turns Figma/Adobe XD/Sketch designs into developer-friendly code (HTML, React, Vue, etc.), with an AI chat mode for changes in real time


 1. Adaptive (adaptive.ai)

Training/foundation: Under the hood, leverages large language models (LLMs), though specifics aren't public. Likely fine-tuned on app-building patterns.
Frontend vs Backend: Primarily focused on frontend/business logic and workflows; it can link apps and data flows, but doesn't generate raw backend code.


 2. Google Stitch
Text + image → UI design + frontend code tool from Google (Gemini 2.5 Pro-powered), launched at I/O 2025. Supports iterative prompts and export/import from Figma/CSS/HTML.

Training: Built on Gemini 2.5 Pro (Google’s advanced LLM fine-tuned for UI/code).
Used for: Frontend UI generation only—does not generate backend services or APIs.

3. Devin AI
A fully autonomous coding assistant that plans, writes, debugs, tests, and deploys code. Developed by Cognition Labs using LLMs with reinforcement learning, among others.
