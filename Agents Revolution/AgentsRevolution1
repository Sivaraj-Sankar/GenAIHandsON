AutoGen Agent [Nested Chat Register, Task Register, Register Function]
Create the Task in Json Format and Register 
Register the Nested Chat - for Nested Conversational Agent 
Register the Tools to the Agent by Register Function, and Provide the tools available in Agent System Message 
**Nested Chat is Important in Chess Game, first agent will take with board to choose the legal move 
**Group Chat Conversation Pattern [Multi Agent Group Chat] - Speaker Transition Policy 
       Contrast - Sequential Chat involves human to build the design for concrete steps and concrete agent involved in each step
**Tool Calling & Code Execution is different in AutoGen(It Uses own, no need of function call or tool call capability by model)

Agentic AI vs AI Agents
AI Agents operate with strict guidelines. They require specific instructions, focus on short-term tasks, only update through reprogramming, respond to direct commands, and handle simple tasks in predictable settings.
Agentic AI operates differently. These systems work independently with minimal human input, focus on long-term goals with adaptive approaches, learn continuously from experiences, consider multiple factors in decisions, and tackle complex tasks in changing environments.
 -Agentic AI represents an architectural shift. These systems involve multiple collaborating agents with dynamic task decomposition, persistent memory, and orchestration layers. They enable higher-level coordination and are suited for complex workflows like research automation, robotic swarms, and medical diagnostics.
Agentic Workflow 
    have Copule of AI Agents 

Types of AI Agents 
1.Learning Agents - AI Learning Agent is a Software Agent that can learn from past experiences and improve its performance
2.Simple Reflex Agents
3.Model Based Reflex Agents
4.Goal-Based Agents 
5.Utility[Tool]-Based Agents
6.


Agentic AI Architecture 
Key Architectural and Algorithmic Solutions
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Tool-augmented reasoning (function calling)
- Agentic Loop: Reasoning, Action, Observation
- Memory Architectures (Episodic, Semantic, Vector)
- Multi-agent orchestration with Role Specialization
- Reflexive and Self-Critique Mechanisms
- Programmatic Prompt Engineering Pipelines
- Causal Modeling and Simulation-based Planning
- Monitoring, Auditing, and Explainability Pipelines
- Governance-aware design with role isolation and traceability
There are all important areas that researchers and developers need to get familiar with to build reliable and robust agentic systems.

Multi Agent Architecture 
------------------------
Comes with Different Architecture 
**Multiple Agents works on the same Shared State
**Supervisor
**Plan and Execute - Plan Execute Replan --There are different variant - Each Task Replan, complete task replan
**Flow Engineering [Graphical Solution]
-What is the right information flow for your agents to take action and think
**Language Agent Tree Search - 
     Tree Search over the state of Possible actions
Generate action and Reflect and goes down based on that action and generates some other sub-actions reflects on that
Throughout all these reflections and it can basically reflect on where in the tree of action states, it want to jump back
So it can backpropagate and update the parent nodes to have more information --> Which may inform future direction from that previous state 
**Persistance is more important 
Langgraph is more controllable - Cyclic and Acyclic graph 

Future RoadMap 
--------------
For AI Agents: Proactive intelligence, continuous learning, trust & safety.
For Agentic AI: Multi-agent scaling, simulation-based planning, ethical governance, and domain-specific systems.
These are all areas that need huge innovations in algorithms, architectures, infrastructure, protocols, and enhancing the models themselves.
