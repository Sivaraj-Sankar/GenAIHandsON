AutoGen Agent [Nested Chat Register, Task Register, Register Function]
Create the Task in Json Format and Register 
Register the Nested Chat - for Nested Conversational Agent 
Register the Tools to the Agent by Register Function, and Provide the tools available in Agent System Message 
**Nested Chat is Important in Chess Game, first agent will take with board to choose the legal move 
**Group Chat Conversation Pattern [Multi Agent Group Chat] 
       Contrast - Sequential Chat involves human to build the design for concrete steps and concrete agent involved in each step
**Tool Calling & Code Execution is different in AutoGen(It Uses own, no need of function call or tool call capability by model)



Agentic AI vs AI Agents
AI Agents operate with strict guidelines. They require specific instructions, focus on short-term tasks, only update through reprogramming, respond to direct commands, and handle simple tasks in predictable settings.
Agentic AI operates differently. These systems work independently with minimal human input, focus on long-term goals with adaptive approaches, learn continuously from experiences, consider multiple factors in decisions, and tackle complex tasks in changing environments.
 -Agentic AI represents an architectural shift. These systems involve multiple collaborating agents with dynamic task decomposition, persistent memory, and orchestration layers. They enable higher-level coordination and are suited for complex workflows like research automation, robotic swarms, and medical diagnostics.

Types of AI Agents 
1.Learning Agents - AI Learning Agent is a Software Agent that can learn from past experiences and improve its performance
2.Simple Reflex Agents
3.Model Based Reflex Agents
4.Goal-Based Agents 
5.Utility[Tool]-Based Agents

Agentic AI Architecture 
Key Architectural and Algorithmic Solutions
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Tool-augmented reasoning (function calling)
- Agentic Loop: Reasoning, Action, Observation
- Memory Architectures (Episodic, Semantic, Vector)
- Multi-agent orchestration with Role Specialization
- Reflexive and Self-Critique Mechanisms
- Programmatic Prompt Engineering Pipelines
- Causal Modeling and Simulation-based Planning
- Monitoring, Auditing, and Explainability Pipelines
- Governance-aware design with role isolation and traceability
There are all important areas that researchers and developers need to get familiar with to build reliable and robust agentic systems.


Future RoadMap 
--------------
For AI Agents: Proactive intelligence, continuous learning, trust & safety.
For Agentic AI: Multi-agent scaling, simulation-based planning, ethical governance, and domain-specific systems.
These are all areas that need huge innovations in algorithms, architectures, infrastructure, protocols, and enhancing the models themselves.
